## 31. Ethnography

### The Definition of Ethnography

>Ethnography is a qualitative orientation to research that emphasizes the detailed observation of people in naturally occurring settings. 

>Ethnography seeks to present a portrait of life as seen and understood by those who live and work within the domain concerned, what it terms an 'appreciative stance', through the direct involvement of the researcher in the setting under investigation.

We should never start to investigate within our own mind and thoughts. The practices of ethnographic work don't need lots of professional training, but it should be investigated with interest and curiosity.

>They bring the willingness to pay attention to people's activities, to attend in detail to how people actually go about their affairs, however ordinary and otherwise unremarkable these affairs might be.

### Common sense principles of conduct

    1. respect your subject
    2. be aware of what people say and do
    3. avoid pre-judgements about what is of interest and what is not

The unfamiliarity of the setting has an analytic utility in helping the ethnographer reveal and document people's mundane work.

>make the ordinary extra-ordinary

**Question:** Would the performance of data collection for a new ethnographer act like a procedure that first only few data found or even no data, to abundant but disoriented data, finally to effective data?
