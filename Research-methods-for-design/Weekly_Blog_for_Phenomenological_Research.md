# Phenomenological Research

### Summary

People are easy to neglect the hidden evidence left from everyday life. Professor John Zeisel provides us a useful while interesting method-physical trace observing, to uncover the hidden behaviors. It could be used to implicate our design opportunities and evaluate what we have designed. In the reading, Dr. Zeisel describes why to use physical trace, how to record physical trace and what to collect. Physical trace study mainly focuses how to discover the interaction between human and environment, what and how people do, whether the environment fits their needs and why it fits and do not fit. Afterwards, new meanings would prompt ideas for next iteration. However, we should be careful of what we found. We need to use other methods like interviews to prove our hypothesis. The idea of what we look for in terms of physical trace are highly constructed. By-product of use, which refers to what we do in the setting, reflects what we do unintentionally. Adaptations for use, what we want to do, reflects our intentional actions to the environment. Why we left things here but not there, how environment is used like this but not that. By using physical trace study, we are uncovering the truth bit by bit.


### Notes taking:

What is the difference between ethnographic research and phenomenological research?

The scope is different, ethnographic research is to understand culture or subculture, while phenomenological research is to understand the experience of a phenomenon.

The methods to implement are different, the former is using participatory observation, while the later is using interviews, focus group, diary study, etc.
Its scope and methods also determine the logic of using them. Auto-ethnography is difficult to do with an activity that someone has done for a long time because It is difficult to notice differences or specifics in a situation you are used to. It is much easier to act as a researcher, noticing and doing an auto-ethnography with a new experience.

However, practically speaking, methods are not used only for one types of research. Based on our prompts and research process, we need clarify what kinds of role we are in different phases. Therefore, choose different methods appropriately and smartly.
