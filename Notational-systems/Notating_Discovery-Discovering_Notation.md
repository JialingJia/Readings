## What is NOTATION

Notation in mathematics is a means of communicating the concepts and their relationships, a conventional sign.

>Notation is something more than the use of symbols – it is their use in an organized way. Notational forms typically have a linguistic character – that is they conform to rules of syntax, and the meaning depends not just on the parts, but how they are combined together.

The practice in Mathematical Notation:
   1. manipulate without thinking
   2. the discovery of new properties is facilitated by the use of notation to handle what is already known.
   3. suggest new ideas-multi-dimensional -an aid to calculation, a way of structuring thinking.

>Notation appears in drawing in a variety of ways. The one which most closely resembles the function of mathematical notation is when individual marks playing an essentially similar role to algebraic symbols in formulae are used.

How we discover notation:

>The route is mapped but not using pre-determined cartographic notation to describe the territory. Instead the walk generates the notation and creates its own representation. The role of the artist in this is as an intermediary who facilitates the translation of environment to visible marks.

>By providing a tool that can conjure signs from the environment, the processes equip the artist with a way of discovering through the discovery of notation
