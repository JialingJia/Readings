**Chapter Eight**
# Hurried Ethnography for Harried Ethnographers
### As an ethnographer, How to consider the length of time when we observe?
The former consider to use enough time to guarantee outcomes, the latter buoyed that we have a constraint time in ethnographic research. Endless time for research might become a problem. **The author wants to tell us how to make sure that the research can be done in a certain period of time in case with no results.** The chapter focused on how ethnographers have been trying to speed up their work without risking the opprobrium of a label Ray Rist.

### Base on purpose, time is manageable.
    1. An inquiry must remain parament with reasonable expectations within time available.
    2. When planning an inquiry, the field work time should be the residual time after organizing and writing.

### Here are some suggestions:
    1. Start writing even if there is no sufficiently new idea, because writing can help you identify areas and warrant study in greater depth. So start writing as quick as possible when in the field.
    2. Start writing when you feel uncertain about when to begin and try to make sense of data already gathered.
    3. Don't try to wait for big events, start writing when you already have "comfortable" topics rather than putting the writing task off for a few more days.
    4. Although it takes more time in organize, wirte and present material than it takes to gather data, we should start to write as we spent in the field.

### Advantages for writing as quickly as possible:
    1. Record first impressions along with reactions and anxieties.
    2. Early writing helps you keep focus on the ultimate purpose of the research, which is to make available to others what you have observed and understood.
    3. It helps you to organize, find the sequence of story, and examine your thoughts, assumptions and emotions. those records will be accessible for your own future use.

## Rapid Appraisal Procedures
Originaly, the idea of rapid survey procedures is "rapid rural appraisal", then it comes to "rapid assessment procedures". After that, when it comes to different discipline, other titles of this kind of procedures come out.

Scientific researcher also urge to be more systematic at the meantime to be more efficient. They also know to find ways to make information available early enough to inform decisions. Ethnographers are excellent for team's research, because they have advantage in working in flexible time frames with rapid assessments.

### The techniques focus on interviewing and direct observation.
Rapid techniques require a clear sense of purpose. Interviewing is to seek out the careful identification of key informants not informants in general.
Group interview is not only for gathering information but also to find the subtleties of constituency-building under the guise of research. ~~*Question-how group interview find out the subtleties of constituency-building?*~~
>Key informant-one or tow individuals with whom they worked intensely for long periods of time.

>Key roles player-who are interviewed only briefly during rapid appraisal procedures.
Observations are conducted with survey sheet or other structure questions and circumstances.
Rapid appraisal relies on directed observation and open-ended survey.

### The roles of team members in a Rapid Appraisal Procedures
In a rapid appraisal procedures, we encourage team members to be an autonomous independent researcher "at least one member is sufficiently well informed to be able to provide the necessary context and to recognize elements critical to moving the work ahead".
Although ethnographer may find ways to speed up the work, the time is too short to use a traditional approach if we focus on highly specific topics. Author advises us to carry out the work in a more "ethnography" traditional way, and if they need to look around first in broader perspective before more detailed inquiries, author proposes the idea of "ethnographic reconnaissance".

### Questions List:
>regardless of the many forms it may take, ethnography should always serve as a rich source of detail

~~Does~~ it means that because they have advantage in working in flexible time frames with rapid assessments.

~~>they build a database from which they can explore or test their assumptions

~~What database?~~

Don't understand what the opinions of the nexus of anthropology and ethnography

*ethnography is considered a research method used in the field of anthropology.
Anthropology is the study of human society. Ethnography is the set of methods used to observe and describe people and their culture.
We use ethnographic research methods (direct observation, participant observation, interviews, etcâ€¦) as part of our experience design research process. In fact, ethnography, as a set of research methods originated in the field of anthropology but is today used in several other files as well, such as marketing, business, etc.*

>the anthropologist interview increase the potential that the data are representative, is more than simply adding numbers for it seeks to increase the representativeness

How they increase the potential in a focus group?

## Ethnographic Reconnaissance: a preliminary examination or survey, usually followed by a more detailed inquiry
It can be conducted for several times during the procedure. In the initial phase of a project, time and resources will be set aside for reconnaissance to find more detailed examination. Other terms like it as "to canvass"(solicit opinions, investigate by inquiry and to exam), practice of "casing" a situation or making initial "probes".
ER encourages researcher to look around for themselves regardless of time constraint or the depth of the inquiry. Researchers can also avoid to endorse qualitative procedures in case of misunderstanding. It a "soft" approach. Researcher may be interrupted by something new in their presence at a research site.

### Suggestions for ER as a Research Strategy
Sometimes even the time for ER is long and enough, and the research time is limited in a week or a day, the investigation approach is also rigid and doctrinaire.
>it can and should serve as a constant reminder for an ongoing assessment of events, viewed in a context broader than the immediate focus of a research inquiry

**Questions:** would it become an interruption or doubt for researchers after an another reconnaissance? maybe the information would lead the research in a wrong way.

### Pointers that should help the researcher realize the maximum return on ethnographic reconnaissance:
    1. Avoid professional bias, let people stay in a common sense
    2. Stay curious and interested, some specific tech tools like clipboard or notepad, tape recorder or camera would be so businesslike that set a wrong tone than natural dialogue.
    3. Let intuition and own natural way to guide you, sometime only you can do is talking to those who you most need to meet.
    4. Don't push so hard for your interviewer, you can explain it later if it is possible.
    5. Write something you learn, including first impressions, problems you anticipate, leads you might follow, analytical concepts you may later want to consider.
    6. If time allowed, outline a more thorough ethnography.
    7. Drafting your final report based on a brief reconnaissance would help you review what you already know and help you to inventory what remains to be investigated.
    8. In all ethnographic interviewing, is to get people to talk without having to ask a lot of direct questions, and to frame the questions that you do ask in ways that make sense locally(semi-structured interview)
    9. Try to look for existing resources to help.
    10. Try to monitor by thinking how other disciplinary researchers might be drawn to the setting you are studying.
**Reconnaissance is a sort of exploratory map-making activity, figuratively if not always literally.**
