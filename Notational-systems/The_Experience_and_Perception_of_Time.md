## The Experience and Perception of Time
We perceive temporal relations of events. When an event past, it is kept in our memory, therefore consider the sense of experience help us to learn how such perception of time is possible.

### Duration

>When we say that an event or interval of time is short or long, what is it that is being described as of short or long duration? 

>It cannot be what is past, since that has ceased to be, and what is non-existent cannot presently have any properties, such as being long." Why it can't be the events in the past, since we have a sense of what had happen, time can be measure by a relative scale.

Present cannot be described as short or long, it has no duration.

>We can concede that the perception of temporal duration is crucially bound up with memory.

Duration is what we infer the time period in our mind.

**Strength model** vs **Inference model**

>Strength model: if the memory trace can persist over time, we can judge the age of a memory.

>Inference model: time period is inferred from information about relations between the even in question and other events whose data or time is known.

**Question:** is it that here the author mention the events is what we call physical event? It means the reflection from our mind and actual world.

### The specious present
William James' description of  "specious present" may lead to confuse, he considered present has a duration(from a few seconds to not more than a minute) when we are immediately and incessantly sensible. The ambiguity comes to "duration" and "immediately sensible".

>The duration which is perceived both as present and as extended in time

**Question:** what does the word "extended" mean? Does the word "extended" mean "successive"?

### Past, present and the passage of time

>It seems that we only ever perceive what is past

What interesting is that, we perceive the past, but we perceive it as present. Causes lead to effects, what we perceive is a causal process, because to perceive something is to be causally affected by it. Therefore, we can never perceive the future, we can only perceive earlier events, never later ones. Now when we start to perceive the present and form a certain belief of what is going on, they are largely accurate ones.

>Memory dispose us to form past-tensed beliefs, and is by virtue of this that they represent an event as past.

### Time order
An event that occurs after another. Time order sometimes is the casual order of perceiving something. For example, when we perceive the *x*, we also have the feeling of the *y* following, that is what we say casual order.

>Mellor's idea is that temporally ordered events are represented by similarly temporally ordered experiences.

>One reason to suppose that it must have other means at its disposal is that time needs to be represented in memory (I recall, both that a was earlier than b, and also the experience of seeing a occur before b) and intention (I intend to F after I G), but there is no obvious way in which Mellor's ‘representation of time by time’ account can be extended to these.

>Dennett (1991) proposes a different model, on which the process is time-independent, but content-sensitive. For example, the brain may infer the temporal order of events by seeing which sequence makes sense of the causal order of those events. One of the advantages of Dennett's model is that it can account for the rather puzzling cases of ‘backwards time referral’, where perceived order does not follow the order of perceptions.

**Question:** Why the author say Mellor's idea is not sensitive to content? Otherwise how to explain the "x" precede "y" example.
