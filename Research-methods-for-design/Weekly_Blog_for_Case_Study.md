# Case study

2003 - Case Study Research_ Design and Methods-Robert K. Yin: social scientist, known for his work on case study research as well as on qualitative research.
What logic does Yin use to establish these three criteria to distinguish strategies?
Incidence and prevalent outcome-what, how much, how many, when, where
Time consuming, operational links needing to be traced over time-how, why

Does it means that, if a contemporary phenomenon is clear for its origins, process, and results, there is no need for investigating it as a case study? (A case study is an empirical inquiry, 13)

>A research design deals with a logical problem and not a logistical problem.

 Does it mean that research design is not to plan the research but to give it a direction?

 How to design proper proposition?

### Summary

 As a qualitative research method, case study is the approach for us to use context-dependent knowledge to learn and develop logic reasoning narrative for different cases. It could be used to generate ideas, verify or falsify concepts and demonstrate open detailed results. Bent Flyvbjerg, from his study in Harvard, was trained to realize that case study helps developing in-depth research skills for context-dependent knowledge. He thoughts, case study is the right way to let simple data collectors become virtuoso expert through the process of context-dependent learning. Via a clever choice of ranging argument knowledge, the "most likely" cases can be used to falsify prior ideas, while the "least likely" cases can be used to confirm minor propositions. After all, its goal is not to come up with conclusion at the end, but to be friendly opened to different explanations from different people. If it is said that the importance of case study is proved by Flyvbjerg through several narrative arguments, Robert K.Yin-the famous social scientist-sets up a solid theory of how to develop compelling case study from a systematic perspective. Generally speaking, each research strategy, no matter what, is served to answer questions of who, what, when, where, why, and how, thus ending with the only question of how to use case study method in its suitable situations.

 As a reading review for Flyvbjerg's paper, he mixes his counter arguments for the previous 5 misunderstandings with his own conclusions of how to think of case study, while leading to the redundancy of revising the four following misunderstandings. It seems that, the "Black Swan" case could be used as evidence to overturn all these misunderstandings, which could be more effectively disapproved by Yin's reasoning systematic view. However, Flyvbjerg highlights the importance of case study as a narrative reference as well as of its subjective argumentation for research learning, which might not be so outstanding in Yin's methodology.

### Notes taking in class

 Case study is a practical learning process. Only facts but not learning in depth or in a real experience cannot make beginners grow, for case study, what matters is the process of how to analyze propositions, develop your theory and utilize data dialectically to construct and evaluate your idea in a context-dependent basis.

 Paradigmatic case represents the dominant thought in that area.
