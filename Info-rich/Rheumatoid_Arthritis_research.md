### The DAS28 score
The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DAS stands for 'disease activity score' and the number 28 refers to the 28 joints that are examined in this assessment.

Developed by Dutch rheumatologists for standardizing and comparing results in clinical trials of new drugs for treating RA. In the UK a score equal or greater than 5.1 is one of the mandatory criteria required to be eligible for NHS funded treatment with biologic (including anti-tumor necrosis factor) therapies.

Once started any biologic treatments, you will have had at least one DAS28 score, and continue to have the DAS28 score measured at least every 6 months, when score fall below 1.2 points, it is no need to take a continuation treatment.

‘treat to target’-One such target might be a DAS28 score of less than 2.6 (indicating remission) or less than 3.2 (low disease activity). Other targets might be a low CRP or ESR.

### DAS28 Score problems in clinical practices

1. Unable to explicitly explain several symptoms
For example if you never have a very high ESR blood result (even during a flare), or if your RA particularly affects the feet (these are not included in the 28 joint count) the score may be misleadingly low. Alternatively if you always have many tender joints when all other markers of inflammation and RA disease activity are quiet the score may be misleadingly high.

2. Uncertainty evaluation in swollen and tender
It can also be difficult to decide whether an individual joint is swollen or tender, and this uncertainty may lead to misleading variability in the score

### The Patient Journey-Initial Hospital Consultation

20-30 minutes long, need to provide information about your medical history and medications, urine specimen, and some common questions asked:

   1. How long have you had joint symptoms?
   2. Which joints have been painful?
   3. Which joints have been swollen?
   4. Do you have morning stiffness and if so for how long?
   5. Have you felt generally unwell, had fevers or lost weight?
   6. Have you noticed any skin nodules or rashes?
   7. What medication have you been given?
   8. Have you had any benefit or side effects from your medication?
   9. Has your arthritis affected your ability to work?
   10. How has your life been affected by the arthritis?
   11. Have you had sleep disturbance or developed depression?
   12. Is there a family history of rheumatoid arthritis?

when in clinic: nurse may take some baseline tests such as blood pressure, heights, weight, urine analysis etc.

A number of questions about the onset, distribution and severity of your joint symptoms whether there is associated stiffness or swelling. And what impact the arthritis has had on your quality of life including your work, your recreational activities and interaction with family and friends. Also with your previous illnesses, social history including occupation, smoking habits and alcohol intake and relevant family history.

### Clinical examination

On the first consultation-a thorough physical examination-undress down to underwear-examine all your joints, neck and spine-looking for tenderness, joint swelling and examining range of movements-them general examination including heart, chest and abdomen, the skin and the nervous system sometimes posture and gait.

### Investigation

Blood test: ESR and CRP;
X-ray: early joint erosions, underlying chest problems("base-line" investigation);
MRI and Ultrasound: For further test, in order to determine the extent of inflammation and damage inside the joints.

### Treatment

Providers: rheumatology nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists and podiatrists

Drugs:
ibuprofen and naproxen-help reduce pain, swelling and stiffness of joints but are purely symptomatic and do not affect the course of the disease.

DMARD therapy
Intra-muscular injections
Assessment of Daily Living

### Why should patients keep tracks on their records

1. Ensure that side effects are avoided or minimized and that the medication is effective in controlling the arthritis.

2. DAS-to achieve clinical remission or low disease activity which may necessitate an increase in the dose of your DMARD or the addition of further DMARDS

3-monthly to once a year

### Pain Points
Complexity in drug treatment;
At the initial consultation only essential information will be provided and it is often difficult to take it all in;
Internet may provide poor or biased information and it’s better to stick to recognized websites.

### ???
To assess the determinants of patients’ *(PTGL)* and physicians’ *(MDGL)* global assessment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) activity and factors associated with discordance among them

### Discordance
Pain perception in RA is not only affected by the degree of inflammatory burden from the ongoing RA activity, but also by the enhanced pain sensitivity (hypernociception) secondary to inflammatory cytokines, autonomic dysfunction, and psychological variables, particularly anxiety and depression;

In addition, there is substantial variability in pain sensitivity in humans that is strongly affected by polymorphisms in genes involved in pain modulation;

There needs to be a “collaborative definition of a problem” that takes into account both the patient-defined problems as well as clinical assessment by the physician. Physicians need to pay more attention to the “disease experience” of the patient. Conversely, physicians may need to educate patients with minimal symptoms about the importance of clinically meaningful changes such as swollen joints and/or elevated inflammatory markers.

The main perceived challenges in diagnosing RA were ‘the earliest phases of RA are difficult to recognize’, and ‘RA can be difficult to distinguish from other potential diagnoses’

### Cause

Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium — the lining of the membranes that surround your joints.

Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors — such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria — that may trigger the disease.
