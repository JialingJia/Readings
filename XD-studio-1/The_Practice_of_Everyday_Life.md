**Part III Spatial Practices chapter VII**

# Walking in the City

Certeau regarded "The City" as an order production by authority and administration, which was transformed and stabalized by modernization and functionalised purpose. But the combination of contradictory movements leave the city impossible to administer.

Certeau compared the spatial movement in city as a "language" or "writing", people walking uncousicously may actuallize new way of constructing our urban spaces. In particular, "pedestrian speech acts" plays a role of fluid and live enunciation of space. But it's different from the spatial system in three phases: "the present", "the discrete", and "the phatic".(98)

**The present**: Spatial movement reflect "a spatial order" organization. Walker may effect these sequences and bring out new possibilities for their "improvisation of walking privilege".

**The discrete**:

>In the same way, the walker transforms each spatial signifier into something else. And if on the one hand he actualizes only a few of possibilities fixed by the constructed order, on the other he increases the number of possibilities and prohibitions. He thus makes a selection. (98)

>"The user of a city picks out certain fragments of the statement in order to actualize them in secret."

**The phatic**:

### Two characteristics of Walking Rhetorics

"Synecdoche" and "asyndeton" are defined as two symple stylistic figures for spatial language by J.-F. Augoyard.

>Synecdoche expands a spatial element in order to make it play the role of a "more" and take its place.

>Asyndeton create a "less", opens gags in the spatial continuum, and retains only selected parts of it that amount almost to relics. "in walking it selects and fragments the space traversed."
