**On Movement and Vantage Points-the Strollologist's Experience**

One cannot remedy the problem, but only limit them(shattered porcelain cannot be glued back together). When try to limit the problem, the more fatal the solution. The remedy for a problem depends on constraints, on certain conditions-and mostly on the cost factor: a thing may only cost this or that much.

Interventions-the allocation of pros and cons. *Game theory-how to manage benefits and expectations for different roles.* Most design solutions are a matter of assuring certain population groups either advantage or disadvantages.

To name the problems isolates from on another, and then so-called solutions are applied to them. Sometimes, problems cannot be named until we understand its complex at the end.

Things are given thought, and the only thing lacking is decision-making. Constraints are likewise design variables, though it's difficult to change, design variables exit. At the start of the design process we really need to invest in the variability range.
