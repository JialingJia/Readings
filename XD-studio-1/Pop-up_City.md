Pop-up City: An urban living strategy or phenomenon for temporary and flexible use of space for residents, showing creative sharing relationship and ...

Today's economy condition and technology development make great influence on human living environment. Therefore, the way that cities were built and managed was also changing.
The economic crisis has led people to think off creative utilization for vacant buildings and empty lots. On the other hand, for the reason of hyper-connected digital media, people's perpective of the city has shifted to a psychogeographical network of "disparate yet connected unban centres".(15)

However, cities' construction have been out of date, as the author points out that "most urban planning departments appear to be stuck in a postwar mode that fails to address the needs of new activities and new users". Those underutilized empty space illustrates a dismatch result for its original purpose. Therefore, author suggests that the future building should consider its multifunctional needs for unexpected use.(16)

>we see Pop-Up City as the city of the not-too-distant future: it is a city where existing urban planning frameworks and architecturual landscapes do not hinder spontaneous human activity, but rather serve as an encouraging platform for inovative and inspirational activities to flourish.

### Anyone can be a City-maker

From author's view, anyone can be a city maker, who add micro view to urban environment and demonstrate its own diversity.(264) Under a developing situation of flexible and fast urban living, he encourages policy frameworks to become more adaptable in order to "prevent the increase of derelict structures and abandoned districts that suffering inflexibility". Several adivces are given for us to practice the thoughts as a city-maker(265-269):

1. Pop-up Thinking: oriented towards quality; channel the methods of architecture, art, and design to create projects that add value to urban space.

2. Design to Add Value: strong concepts-initiate with a problem, a need or even just a space for increased convenience; decision-oriented deisgn: strategically assign tasks to those most capable; time limit, temporal dimension

3. Generate Momentum: inspire others, toying with the emotions and psychologies of people.

4. Deisgn digitally

5. Do it together: breaks a predefined set of spatial partners, creating room for short-term, issue-centered collaborations.

**Queston:** "the pop-up city is awash in temporary initiatives that contribute to any one of the six realms of urbanity by recognising a need" what are the six realms of urbanity.(265, #1)

A public second-hand market or temporary pop-up shop is what might motivate social and neighborhood energy. During the observation in our group work, we found a place where people spontaineously gather together, selling and buying. They utilize the back yard of a church, where provide enough space and shade for people to sit and stay comfortable.
