# The Theory of Notation

## The definition of Notation
Notation is kind of a class that identify work from performance to performance. It also has other functions like facilitating transposition, comprehension, or even composition.
>First, a score must define a work, marking off the performances that belong to the work from those that do not.

Score is a general form that all performance belonged to the same work can be identified, and all copies of scores can define the same class of performances. Score and performance both can be explained and determined with each other.

## Syntactic Requirements
### The first necessary condition for a notation is character-indifference among the instances of each character.
>The essential feature of a character in a notation is that its members may be freely exchanged for one another without any syntactical effect.

>Characters must thus be disjoint. The character of the notational scheme can be moved, copied.

It is difficult to classify characters into a precise and delicate way.

>So the disjoint of the characters is also somewhat surprising.

When it comes to classify the mark in a technological way, so long as the different is finite, no matter how small we find, the determination of membership of mark depend upon the acuteness of our perception and sensitivity. But if the differentiation is infinite, it is impossible for us to keep characters separately. But it won't bother the meaning of disjoint classes of marks, it only makes hard the determination of the membership of some marks in such classes. Nevertheless, for a notational scheme, error must be at least theoretically avoidable.

### The second requirement is that the characters can be finitely differentiated.

Finite differentiation has no bond relationship with the finite number of characters. For example, a notational scheme such as Arabic factional notation provide for an infinite number of finitely differentiated characters, while another example like all marks not longer than one inch belong to one character, and all longer marks belong to the other, such example is not a finite differentiation.
>It is not suggested that character-indifference between mark is any simple function of shape, size, etc.

>The finite differentiation is satisfied by a scheme where all inscriptions are conspicuously different but some two characters have at least one inscription in common.

**Question:** Why does it say "two characters have at least one inscription in common"?

>The two requirements are not meant to describe the class of what are ordinarily called notations, but are rather conditions that must be fulfilled if the basic theoretic purpose of a score is to be served.

## Composition of Characters
>The most useful treatment here calls for atoms sorted into categories(note-signs, clef-signs, time-signs, etc.) and for rules that not only make reference to these categories but provide for combination in two dimensions.

Atomic inscriptions only need to be discrete when it comes to notation in question. like

**question:** does the explanation of the "add" composition mean that words are formed by characters one by one.

## Compliance
>A symbol system consists of a symbol scheme correlated with a field of **reference**.

>Compliance requires no special conformity.

Sound is a compliance for sound-English while in object-English some inscriptions may not have compliance.

**Uncertain thoughts:**

    In a notation system, if the compliance of words lies in the relationship of its combination, like "c""t"-together become the *composite* string "ct", can we classify that relation to a composite-class?

**Composite** vs **Prime**
>Composite: the compliance of components stand in the relation of the inscription-combination

>Prime: any other nonvacant inscription

## Semantic Requirements

    No ambiguous inscription
    The compliance-classes must be disjoint
    Semantic finite differentiation
