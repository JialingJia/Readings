### Summary

Futuring, as an approach for us to explore a possible or relevant future situation in a given time, is mostly used to do with sustainability development in energy, urban, and policy planning. From Quist’s book, we understand that backcasting, as a well-known approach focusing on desirable and attainable futures, is to define a strategic objective and investigate what policy measures should be implemented to guide them in its transformation towards this future. First, it lists out three kinds of future-futures, possible futures and desirable futures. Then it points out that the normative or desirable future is a more reasonable way to be focused in backcasting. During the brief introduction of backcasting, I learn that the main result of backcasting studies are alternative images of the future, and these images should provide a practical input to a policy developing process. By comparing different backcasting methods, Quist summarized a 5-steps implementation of backcasting. Although the approach is depicted in a linear way, Quist points out that backcasting is a dynamic and iterative experiment. Furthermore, it is of particular importance to invite different stakeholders to participate in it.

In Fry’s book-Design Futuring, he proposed the approach of redirective practice, which focus on how we can design for change. Similar with the goal of a desirable future in backcasting, both focus on sustainability. As Fry points out that redirecitive practice is underpinned by a combination of creating and gathering old knowledge directed at advancing means of sustainability while also politically contesting the unsustainable status quo. We are going to design in time based on what the current situation is. From the case Boonah Two, the implement policy is proposed by directly connected to its region’s ecological carrying capacity and natural resources, such as water, soil, and biodiversity. They define short-term core and long-term potential for the plan, how industry and local economy would work together. To achieve the sustainability, policy is required to deliver a message for people that they don’t need too much as what they thought. As the picture shows, government are selling the vision for their people. In the area of country development and culture, redirective practice is designing the social condition and create the value of what is normal.

Scenarios, as a way for us to present the future states, is to make design ideas explicit and concrete. By creating the future scenarios from a persona’s point of view, it helps us to align different teams with a shared understanding. Based on these future visions that are agreed on by different stakeholders, we can backcast the development process in several time phases. Another important takeaway from Martin and Huntington is that building scenarios give the priority of culture artifacts that augment actual day-to-day human activity, rather than the tendency on technical requirement.

### Notes taking in class

Backcasting for a sustainable future

2.2.1: the origin of backcasting
An exploration of backcasting and related approaches
3 kinds of futures- what are the differences among them
Backcasting is a well-known approach focusing on desirable and attainable futures.
Sustainable development
Lovins proposed backcasting
Desirable future is more reasonable.
Define a Strategic objective then what policy measures should be implemented to guide them in its transformation towards the future.
implications of different policy goals for different alternative energy futures
Robinson-relative feasibility and different social, environmental and political implication

2.2.2: how backcasting develops into the sustainability
Dreborg, broaden the scope of solutions to be considered by describing new options and different futures.
Sustainability problems-dominant trend, externalities, a need for major change
CTA
the main result of backcasting studies are alternative images of the future,
constructive-oriented side- an input to a policy developing process
complementary
Höjer and Mattsson, they favour backcasting in cases where existing trends are leading towards an unfavourable state. Using models and regular forecasting tools to quantify the consequences of different measures.


2.2.3: participatory backcasting
broad stakeholder participation, future visions or normative scenarios, and the use of creativity to reach beyond existing mind sets and paradigms.
Vergragt and Jansen, an operational plan
Green and Vergragt, conclude that stakeholders should not only be involved in constructing normative scenarios, but also in the economic and environmental assessment of the normative scenarios.

2.2.4: relevant approaches
TM-transitions towards sustainability, normative future visions as a core element, in addition to long-term thinking as a framework for short-term policy, more open, keep various options open by working towards different versions at the same time.
CTA and PTA- the focus of these types of approaches is not on generating normative or desirable futures, but on broadening the process of technology development and related decision making with societal aspects and societal actors.

2.3: the differences of four main backcasting practices
Robinson’s-exploring the implications of alternative developments paths and underlying values. Future goals, objectives and constraints, construction of future scenarios, iteration of scenario construction
The Natural Step-sustainability criteria, more employee involvement, discussing wide and open results
STD-long-term then short-term, more elaborative,
SusHouse-stakeholder analysis,

2.4.2 five steps of participatory backcasting
STEP 1: Strategic problem orientation STEP 2: Develop future vision STEP 3: Backcasting analysis STEP 4: Elaborate future alternative & define follow-up agenda STEP 5: Embed results and agenda & stimulate follow-up It
although the approach is depicted in a linear way, it definitely is not.
Backcasting experiement is dynamic. Four major societal groups can be distinguished: companies, research bodies, government and public interest groups and the general public.

2.4.3 a toolkit of four categories of methods
1. tools and methods to generate stakeholder creativity, help backcasting activities and tools for participatory vision and scenario construction.
2. elaboration and detailing systems
3. analytical tools and methods for assessment and evaluation
4. management, coordination and communication tools and methods

2.5 conclusion
The advantages of normative or desirable future studies-the applicability in sustainable development
Finally, three key concepts can be identified in participatory backcasting: (1) desirable futures, also
called future visions, (2) stakeholder participation, and (3) learning by stakeholders.

Suggested Questions:
What is the origin of backcasting, and which types of future study it belongs to ?
How it develops into the sustainability?
How it shifts to participatory backcasting?
What kinds of principle or accounts should we consider when developing participatory backcasting?

Design Futuring
Framing Design as a Redirective Practice
Design to change
Sustainability and user-centered design
Cooperation by different disciplinary people
Meta-discipline, different disciplines need to be bridged by a meta-discipline that facilitates an exchange of knowledge and dialogue based on a common language of engagement, while also amassing collective knowledge.
New knowledge-sustainability

 The Redirective Base Line
Redirecitive practice, as expounded here, is akin to a new kind of design leadership, underpinned by a combination of creating and gathering old knowledge directed at advancing means of sustainability while also politically contesting the unsustainable status quo.
that associated activity may not just be confined to design, or that the only disciplines engaged to work on it will be design based or design related.

Design in-time – how the things is becoming
Acting in the medium in time, acting with emergency
Design with them not just for them

Case Study- Boonah Two
The intent was to put experientially omnipresent forms and structures in place, including learning environments that would dramatically increase the ability of the city to sustain itself and in so doing advance sustainment in general.
Metabolic City- need to be designed and managed within the immediate catchment of its settlement. The city-directly connected to its region’s ecological carrying capacity and natural resources. (water, soil, biodiversity)
Catchment
Construction Methods
Short-term core: nascent local economy as a catalyst for social and economic development
Long term potential: Industry
Convergence of efficiencies of industrial production while reducing transportation energy and financial costs
System in transition
