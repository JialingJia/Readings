### Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning

Social problems are "wicked". They are hard to define and impossible to resolve, for their blurred contour and reviving issues. During the industrial age, the idea of efficiency has become guiding concept in different areas. It reduces the original difficult tasks of problem solving. In planning task, we start to create an on-going, cybernetic, argumentative process, where output may become input, tying open systems into large and interconnected networks of systems.

The information needed to understand the problem depends upon one's idea for solving it. *Every question asking for additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem--and its resolution--at that time. Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.*

Wicked problem has no criteria. Because the process of solving the problem is identical with the process of understanding its nature, and there are no criteria for sufficient understanding and no end to casual chains that link to open system.

Solutions for wicked problem are evaluated in terms of effectiveness based on their own uniqueness.
