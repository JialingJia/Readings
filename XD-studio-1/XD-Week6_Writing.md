This assignment was written as a brief and broad review for the reading materials and also as a "ethnographic reconnaissance" plan for the Columbia Road Project.

# The Importance of Walk
As a rail and car power, United State witnesses its fast-developing economy boosting the modern city formation. Compared with warm and cozy path in European suburban area and village, cold and deserted highways expand across America central cities to wilderness. When I first came to Columbia Road-a bridge connecting Boston Emerald Necklace, I become timid by the galloping vehicles and even cannot move my legs across the road. It leads me to the difficulties of how to revive the neighborliness in this place. As Hethrington describes, people's mobility in urban spatiality might help to analyze the relation from the past and to the present and future (22). And from Certeau point of view, people walking unconsciously may actualize new way of constructing our urban spaces (98). Therefore, a road discouraging pedestrian's walk is hard to realize the "culture rhythm" and enhance the interrelation between urban materials and human lives. I suggest it would be an opportunity to retrospect how people walk in the road and improve their walking experience. I would like to discuss walking experience from two dimensions, walking safety and neighborhood walk.

### Walking Safety
From the talk of Nick Jackson, we know lots of techniques on how to build safe sidewalks, bike lane, how to set up appropriate bus stop and how to consider walking accessibility for disable people. On the other hand, we can also explore how people use smartphone when walking. In the Self-observation on street assigned by the XD studio class. One of my classmates observes how she used smartphone when walking across the street. She points out that "Smartphone makes you feel isolated from street", which serve as a discourse for Goldberger's view that "people who walk down the street using their mobile phones are no longer participating in street life: they are there in body but not in spirit". To my perspective, the goal we explore smartphone street experience might help to mitigate the uncomforted and gap of media technology tense with participation in street life.

### Neighborhood Walk
In the neighborhood living, we find that making a neighborhood lively takes time and energy (Walljasper, 14). People felt too busy to get involved in their communities. Therefore, how to refresh neighborhood involvements in a hurry life is more valuable in today's world. It seems to be a contradiction of encouraging people’s walking involvement while maintaining their fast-paced life. However, it is worthy of improving their walking quality in each step first. Only when we create a friendly walking environment, can we expect their enhanced involvements afterwards. Walking, as the first entrance for a neighborhood living, should be encouraged by more incentives and opportunities.

### Research Strategy

#### Ideas form when you keep writing
In the preview three class exercises, I practice a lot on writing down as soon as possible in the start of research, recording and sketching in the first place. Such ethnographic methods give me a representative qualitative survey on our topics. For example, when depicting the smell city, I figure out how ambient scents differ from product scent and how the later transform to the former, also including how different quality of scents demonstrates their visual representation (Henshaw, 156).

#### Plan ahead
As a 'soft' approach, described by Wolcott, in the initial phase of a project, time and resources will be set aside for reconnaisance to explore more possibilities (208). And we are not limited on implementing actual statue, product or any pop-up events on the road.
