# Ethnographic Research

Exploratory Research / Photo studies / Shadowing / Think-aloud Protocol / Observations

### Summary

Among all different ethnographic research methods, photo study stands out for its efficiency of timing and spatiality. It enables us to unpack process and components of the accident, before long, we can photography the subjects or spaces for a second round to rediscover relationship between the whole and the part from a system perspective. On the other hand, if we study photo feeds in any social media platform, it also allowed us to understand people’s potential thoughts and behaviors behind the post.

Shadowing provides us opportunities to collect insights from subjects “detailed nuance of firsthand, real-time exposure” as an outside observer. However, people’s behaviors always change when noticing they are being watched. It would be more valuable when it comes to common and less private research for the subjects.

Think-aloud protocol allows subjects to articulate what they are doing, thinking and feeling concurrently or retrospectively along the research, providing immediate and effective information, while at the same time, enable evaluators to collect results from people’s behaviors with instant orders, as described in the textbook, we can “identify the aspects of a product that delight, confuse, and frustrate people…”.

Reviewing the pieces from Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes, it mainly describes how to make field notes in ongoing events. Technically speaking, ethnographers should note down their first impressions of the setting, significant or unexpected surprise, troubles or problems, how routine actions are organized and formed, as well as open to different forms of the experience. When jotting, we should capture detailed background, avoid personal assuming and reasoning, avoid “inefficient” words which only evoke vague memory for later full descriptions, and try to collect detailed aspects of scenes, such as talk, interactions, gestures and facial expressions. Other than pre-assumption of personal feeling, sometimes jotting down impressions and feelings would help to lead detailed observations afterwards.

When it comes to the role playing for ethnographer in the events, Emerson/Fretz/Shaw think, they need to “draws upon her own reactions to identify issues of possible importance to people in the setting but privileges their ‘insider’ descriptions and categories over her own ‘outsider’ views” (29). Although it’s difficult for us to stand on the edge of participations, some techniques such as asking open ended questions, re-planned manual, pair interview and even taking field notes itself could help ethnographers lift out from the experience.

### Notes taking in class

The value of ethnographic research is to uncover the truth of time. It enables us to highlight the part from whole with a richer understanding, and refresh our feelings in the past. Although only touching the surface of truth, this initial research is irreducible for deeper studies.
