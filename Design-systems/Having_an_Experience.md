## Having an Experience

Under conditions of resistance and conflict, aspects and elements of the self and the world that are implicated in this interaction qualify experience with emotions and ideas so that conscious intent emerges. There is distraction and dispersion of extraneous interruptions or inner lethargy that stop our experiences.(36) That is a whole and carries with it its own individualizing quality and self-sufficiency is an experience.

     1. no sacrifice of the self-identity of the parts;
     2. punctuate and define the quality of movement;
     3. is a unity with a single quality;
     4. premise and conclusion;
     5. esthetic quality;
     6. has pattern and structure, consists of what it is doing and undergoing in relationship;

Activity which runs so automatically, coming to an end without a close or consummation in consciousness, is an experience without esthetic quality.(40)

Anesthetic experience: no connection of one incident with what went before and what comes after. We yield according to external pressure, or evade and compromise. There are no genuine initiations and conclusion. "Thus the non-esthetic lies within two limits. One is the loose succession, one is arrest, constriction, proceeding from parts having only mechanical connection with one another."(41)

Stone overcomes difficulties that hinder its route. "it is interested in the things it meets on its way, conditions that accelerate and retard its movement with respect to their bearing on the end; that it acts and feels toward them according to the hindering or helping function it attributes to them; and that the final coming to rest is related to all that went before as the culmination of a continuous movement. Then the stone would have an experience, and one with esthetic quality"(41)

"There is, as will appear later, an element of undergoing, of suffering in its large sense, in every experience. Otherwise there would be no taking in of what preceded...It involves reconstruction which may be painful."

Enemies of esthetic quality: humdrum; slackness of loose ends; submission to convention.

Emotions come from a stage, an event within space and time developing. "In order to become emotional they must become parts of an inclusive and enduring situation that involves concern of objects and their issues."(44)

Two men meet, an applicant for a position, the other has the disposition of the matter in his hands. Emotions of the applicant like hope, despair at the beginning and elation or disappointment at the close, qualify the experience as a unity.

The common pattern for experience is the result of interaction between a live creature and some aspect of the world in which he lives.(45)

Unbalance on either side of doing or receiving, blurs the perception of relations and leaves the experience partial and distorted, with scant or false meaning.(46) Mere receiving such as day-dreamer, have more intense impressions pass through their consciousness breaks the balance. "Some decisive action is needed in order to establish contract with the realities of the world and in order that impressions may be so related to facts that their value is tested and organized".(47)

>As one part leads into another and as one part carries on what went before, each gains distinctness in itself. The enduring whole is diversified by successive phases that are emphases of its varied colors.
(Does the sentences describe "flow" or "experience"? )

>Esthetic quality-signs or symbols having no intrinsic quality of their own, but standing for things that may in another experience be qualitatively experienced.
(How to understand the esthetic quality of thinking)

The beauty of experience not lies in the flower, it lies in the interaction between you and the flower.

>Between the poles of aimlessness and mechanical efficiency, there lie those courses of action in which through successive deeds there runs a sense of growing meaning conserved and accumulating toward an end that is felt as accomplishment of a process.

Uncertain about the "Conclusion", does it mean the experience of thinking actually include premise and "conclusion" simultaneously?

Don't understand the "morality", great defect-anesthetic quality
