## Overview

The author try to extend the smell study from its use in product consumption marketing to a urban spatial scale.

It is acknowledged that people are familiar with "visual symbols" like "logos in urban place promotion". Although smell study has been well constructed in retailing, at the same time combined with other sensory effects like hearing, touching in marketing service setting, it is exciting to explore how to extend "the scope of olfactory marketing from managed service contexts to the wider urban environment".(154)

>This visual emphasis is consistent with principles of corporate communications (see Melewar, 2003), which have more recently been used to underpin our understanding of place branding activity.(154)

The article discoveries threefold contribution to theory and practice:
     1. demonstrating the current use of smell in city marketing
     2. ways in which smell might be used in future urban place marketing activities
     3. propose that olfaction is an  effective way of incorporating a more participatory modus operandi within urban place marketing effort

### Smell in the marketing of managed and spatially bounded service environments

People have strong feeling on scent.(report that over 75% of emotions are generate by smell, customers within retail outlets react directly on their surrounding smell, 155) Furthermore, it also illustrates its predominate connection with memory and nostalgia.(156) In retrospective, marketers try to use smell in manipulating consumer behavior, especially in company branding.(Singapore Airlines, 156)

##### Three Categories of Scent:
(Bradford and Desrochers, 2009)
     1. Marketer scents: explicit promotional tool, citing as examples the new car smell at a car dealership or the baking smell in a house for sale.
     2. Product scent: the scent itself is the product and would include goods such as perfumes, air fresheners and deodorizers.
     3. Ambient scent: a general odor that does not emanate from a product but is present as part of a retail environment via some form of technological intervention

Author refines the definition of Ambient scent:
> However, this concept neglects the fact that an ambient scent need not result from technological intervention (i.e. it may occur naturally within the service environment as a result of some activity or process; e.g. the smell of coffee in a coffee shop).(156)

### Urban olfaction

> Accepting the notion of the city as a service scape, we adopt a multidisciplinary perspective to consider how smell can be produced and received/consumed within city environments.(156)

#### Smell production

Intentionality: "purposely introduced within a locale"(a series of scented advertisements by food processing company McCain, 157). However, author points out that "these odors can spill out to ‘pollute’ the surrounding urban area."(157)

Scope and duration: "emanate over a wider areal scale, encompassing neighborhoods or whole districts".

> For example the McCain advert are often localized around the source of olfactory production(bus shelters), as well as unintentional smells.

#### Smell reception/consumption

Base on the theory of natural association between people's emotion feeling and smell, author try to discuss how leveraging olfaction may be one route to trigger people's nostalgic mythology of a certain place.

First, the degree of liking of a smell is varied between local residence and visitors. Some residence regards local smell as a critical part of tradition culture.(smell of brewing and distilling of Edinburgh's identity, 158)

Practice opportunities by Henshaw(158):
>a multilayered conceptualization: urban smell scopes can operate at the micro-level of the specific site, the mid-level of the neighborhood and the macro-level of the whole city.

Micro-level: intense and sensed immediately by the potential receiver, but dissipating rapidly.

Macro-level: have a background depth, can linger for much longer.

#### Marketing urban places through smell

Current use: deliberately use to attract visitors by marketer and product scents.(York in UK and souvenir good in Parma, 159)

Spatial challenges: lies in the external environment conditions like weather, temperature, local topography and microclimates. Author suggests that smell can be added intentionally or unintentionally by planners and architects.(159)

Ethical challenges: the degree of liking for smell, which suggests that:
> if ambient smells are to be introduced intentionally into urban environments for marketing purposes, they may need to be ‘narrow-casted’ (so that they are only targeted towards individuals who have previously agreed to receiving the olfactory stimulus in question), as opposed to being broadcast more widely.

### Future actions

Author tries to focus on how to emphasize or celebrate those ambient smell that already exist through various tools and channels, rather than creating new olfactory experience.

     1. Smells need to be of wide enough scope and long enough duration to become an identifiable "olfactory brand asset"(World Perfume Capital, 161)
     2. narratives for this in social media forums-woven into the collective memory and understanding of its residents and visitors-trigger emotional nostalgic reactions.
     3. experiential marketing perspective(Smell-walks and Smell-maps, 162)
     4. social media platforms to talk about smells within a place-olfaction's contribution to place identity.
