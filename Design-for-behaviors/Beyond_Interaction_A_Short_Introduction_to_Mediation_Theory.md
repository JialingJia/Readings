# Beyond Interaction: A Short Introduction to Mediation Theory

### Reading Notes:
With the emerge of intelligent IOT and robotic technology, humans are immersed in hybrid intertwining environment. This situation makes me realized that the practice of design is shifting from merely user-centered concept to cyber-systematic understanding, and leading to the discussion of how we can schematize or plan the improvisation reaction between human and intelligent environment, how can we build tools to uncover this hybrid relationship.

The “types of influence” could be used for us to interpret how service meets people’s expectation and how deep that satisfaction is, and to learn or even design how to manage that influence for users from each touchpoint. If a service journey is considered as a narrative story, how this implementation of user’s impressions can be guided by the story arc model. However, the strategy is not designed for manipulating people's expectations, but trying to fulfill people's potential needs.  

interaction: determine the quality of your wait
technology start to be responsive for human
expectation change through Technology
when lifting weigh change physical make up of yourself
iterative response
role of technology change
technology decide the use case
how to leverage the different extent of influence between T and H
able to predict improvisation results or match?

### Reading Highlights:

Human-Technology Relations
>The interactions…are often characterized in terms of functions and use…smart lighting in shop windows…or electrodes implanted in the brain to influence brain activity…the configurations of users and technologies that arise here can be better characterized as immersion and fusion than as use.

Extensions
>As extensions, they merely facilitate human practices and experiences, rather than actively helping to shape them…humans can share responsibilities with technologies, and therefore provides an unjustified moral excuse…Cognition…is extended to the material artifacts people use.

Hybridity
>...intertwining…technologies and human beings help to shape each other…What a star, the brain, and an unborn child are for us cannot be understood without taking into account the mediating role of technologies in our perception and understanding of them… Products do not only have functional, interactive, and aesthetic qualities, but are in fact also mediators in the lives of human beings.

Mediation Theory
>…ranging from being “embodied” and being “read” to being “interacted with” and being “in the background.”

>Embodiment: The existing of people activities are realized by technology; Hermeneutic: The world is viewed by human through technology interpretation; Alterity: People interact with technology (interdependent entity); Background: Technologies are a context for human existence; Cyborg: Humans are merged with technology; Immersion: Technology and human are interreacting; Augmentation: “combining an embodiment relation and a hermeneutic relation”

Types of influence
>apparent influences: coercive and persuasive; hidden influence: seductive; both strong and hidden: decisive or implicative
