# Thinking Maps: a language of visual tools that help people expand their thinking abilities.

Why have thinking map?

    1. inconsistent use and lack of clear definitions may be confusing students' thinking rather than clarifying it.
    2. inconsistency in the use of these tools prevents individual students from ever mastering any of these valuable techniques.
    3. in the intellectual rigor of learning a new language as students use a common symbol system for integrating, coordinating, and depicting their ideas.

## Five Characteristics

### Consistent Graphics:a common visual language ot represent our thinking.
Although the basic elements are the same and universal, people who use them draw differently base on their own knowledge. And due to its consistent form and meaning of the graphic, we can understand about the construction of knowledge.

### Flexibility of Forms

>A Tree Map: starting from the bottom(inductively) or the top(deductively)

### Developmental Use from Novice to Expert

The tools are suitable for all ages.

>That a novice is able to move from a simple view of one process, such as sequencing, to develop a deeper and differently complex understanding of this process.

### Intertrated and interdisciplinary Use of Maps

### Reflectiveness

>metacognitive abilities or epistemic cognition

>Metacognitive activity often depends on teachers' asking the questions that will facilitate students' reflective thinking.

The eight graphic patterns match people's cognition as representing(in context), describing attributes, comparing, categorizing, part-whole relationships, sequencing, cause-and-effect reasoning, and relational reasoning(reasoning by analogy).

Be aware of using this visual language, because it may let you thinking constrain into the pattern.

Thinking Map helps student to cooperate with each other, they are inspired by others constructions and thoughts

## Three points to evaluate people's thinking map: clarifying , expanding, and assimilating
