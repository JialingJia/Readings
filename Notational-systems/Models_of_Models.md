# Models of Models

We create models as a way to explain or represent what we observe.

>The formal representation of the system that he builds is called a model

>Making Sense and Guiding Action

### Characteristics(2)

1. It represents what we observe
2. It helps us predict likely futures
3. We learn mistakes from models and reform it
4. It provides a basis for shared understanding.

Interesting part(4):
>At each scale, three levels of process are at work:

>1)Primary—the activity at hand;  understood through models

>2)Second-order—direct learning (and designing); improving primary processes,  that is, refining models  of primary processes

>3)Third-order—meta-learning  (learning about learning);  improving second-order processes, that is, improving models of learning  and models of models

Model also will limit creators thoughts and possibilities to create new models. On the other hand, new model also cost time and energy for us to adopt it.

>Adoption requires value that clearly outweighs cost.(4)

How Models share(5)

1. Shared models inspire discussion.
2. It leads to understanding, agreement, and group action.
3. Agreement with individual understanding form our own models.

### Models in Design

>But when attention turns to systems, modeling becomes the essence of design.  Design education and practice must adapt  to this changing reality.(6)
