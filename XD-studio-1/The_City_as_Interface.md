**Chapter One**

## The City as Interface

Author proposes "Ideology" rather than magic when technology is interwined with urban society. He points out that today's technology are less explained from a view of philosophy, leading to a gap or unadaptation with communities.

"Smart City" which embodies how Bill Gates thoughts suggested that smartphone may become the control center portal boost people's urban experience-"software that recommends restaurants or shops that fit the user’s profile". However, critics come from the view that media technology causes less indicidual participation and social relation of communities.

>American architecture critic Paul Goldberger says that "the very media and communication technol- ogies that make life for individual consumers so much easier are a threat to the continued existence of urban society as a whole.

>Goldberger claims that people who walk down the street using their mobile phones are no longer participating in street life: they are there in body but not in spirit. And it is this very attitude that poses a threat to poses a threat to how the city functions as a democratic community.

> the street is the ultimate public space and walking along it is the defining urban experience. It is all of us – different people who lead different lives – coming together in the urban mixing chamber. But what if half of them are elsewhere, there in body but not in any other way?(P. Goldberger, ‘Disconnected Urbanism’)

### Debate-Media technology on urban communities

#### Isolation

Such expression from Goldberger reminds me of the Self-observation on street assigned by the XD studio class. One of my classmates observe how she used smartphone when walking across the street. She points out that "Smartphone makes you feel isolated from street", which serve as a discourse for Goldberger's view. On the other hand, Prof. Kloeckl views it as an oppotunity for us to improve the experience when using smartphone on street-"Strategy how you avoid chaoes in order to use phone on street". To my perspective, the goal we explore smartphone street experience is to mitigate the uncomfort and gap of media technology tense with participation in street life.

#### Enhancement
>According to Blum, ‘in a community where common ties are electronically buttressed we may be able to reap the global environmental benefit of high-density living without sacrificing the local ties of a medium-density neighborhood’.

### Philosophy of Media-tech City

Author proposes three philosophy ideas of city(overlapping with each other): "the libertarian city, the republican city and the communitarian city".

#### the libertarian city
>The city is a place where people lead their individual lives in free- dom; it is a place where city dwellers have virtually no reciprocal duties or responsibilities.

#### the republican city
>Here, the city also provides the free- dom to choose between divergent ways of life, but at the same time city dwellers share responsibility for the city as a whole

#### the communitarian city
>which is based on the ideal of a harmonious local community in which all city dwellers share more or less the same way of life. In this vision the emphasis is on the common identity of the collective and not on the individual

Besides, author also mentions a kinship "between the village-like communitarian ideal and modernist ideas that have long played a dominant role in urban planning".

>The architect was to use scientific methods to determine ideal social relationships and convert them into a physical form that would provide city dwellers with a new collective world of experience: an experiential world that did not arouse nostalgic feelings of togetherness but, instead, a feeling of solidarity that fitted in with the mobility, speed and new technologies of modern life.

Author thinks that it is too coercive and offers less freedom in the communitarian society, and also it is so free that the libertarian city leads to far-reaching fragmentation and segregation.

>The difficult task of finding a balance between freedom and mutual involvement is central to the republican city.

The use of urban public sphere has been identified with different purposes from the three ideolgies. Therefore, author proposes that "the way urban media intervene in this process also determines the direction in which urban communities develop".

### Urban Public Sphere Concept Developing
1. City dwellers met at the coffee houses as citizens to discuss matters of general interest.(German philosopher Jürgen Habermas and the American sociologist Richard Sennett)
2. Physical confrontation between different worlds.(Charles Baudelaire and Walter Benjamin)
3. Trust can develop over time as neighbourhood residents regularly meet on the street.(Jane Jacobs)
4. A group of people who are (temporarily) united around a common goal or practice.(Martijn de Waal, the author)

##### Public:
1. a collection of people who (coincidentally) share a common experience or a common interest
2. something that is ‘public’ is disclosed to others.

From the view of the libertarian city, public might refer to a definition of collection of people, which neglects or undermines social relationships among audience.

The interactions witin public may set parts and lead to class-consciousness.

>This mutual recognition could give rise to a sense of solidarity and perhaps even political action.

>Both publics emerged out of practices that over time had become associated with specific urban locations. Both the seventeenth- century English coffee house and the nineteenth-century boulevard had a set of cultural repertoires: a collection of roles and acts that were connected with and considered appropriate for a particular location.

>Great cities are not like towns, only larger; they are not like suburbs, only denser. They differ from towns and suburbs in basic ways, and one of these is that cities are, by definition, full of strangers. To any one person, strangers are far more common in big cities than acquaintances. In short, the very nature of the city means that we are always sur- rounded by people who are different from ourselves and that most of our fellow city dwellers will also remain strangers to us. Yet in one way or another we must find a way to live with each other.(Jane Jacobs)

City embraces strangers in different backgrounds, while from the view of Louis Wirth, that offers new oppotunities to form new urban publics.

>City dwellers started to specialize, and they also started to become part of various communities and publics for different aspects of their lives.

New digital media also create a virtual spatial place for strangers to meet together, therefore, author investigate the process how new publics emerge.

### Blurred and interwined boundary between public and private

‘parochial sphere’:a third, intermediate sphere between the public and private.

Interesting description: "As such, both domains also have an important function: in parochial domains **city dwellers can be absorbed into all sorts of collectives**, in the public domain **they have to relate to each other**."

Questions are raised about how today's digital media influece the different domains.

>how do urban media enable us to shape these different domains in new ways? How does the emergence of a new technology shift the balance between parochial and public domains? Does the emergence of new technol- ogies reinforce the parochial domain, and do new technologies make it easier for city dwellers to withdraw to their own ‘turf ’? Or can they actually reinforce the public domain, which is dominated by mutual interchange?
