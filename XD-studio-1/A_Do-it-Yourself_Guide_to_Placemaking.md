**Chapter One**

### Feeling Right at Home

#### More exchanges create more rich and satisfying life.

D.Jean Hester-Central Square neighborhood-greeting-with icy stares and nasty looks back.

>So make it your mission to spread a little cheer all around. You may improve more than your neighborhood

Case: 2005, Marcucci, set up a bench on the corner of his front yard. Old people rest there and kids sit there waiting for the bus; no one question.

> Itâ€™s added a really friendly atmosphere to the neighborhood.

Create social activities to revive old-fashioned neighborliness:
1. Case1: Parents in the Kingfield neighborhood of Minneapolis maintain a babysitting co-op.
2. Case2: Online public service: A couple of hundred people, including public officials, closely monitor the opinions and discussions on-line, which means that things get done.
3. Case3: Set up an ad hoc welcoming committee to formally greet your new neighbors... newcomers are greeted with a packet of information on neighborhood history (including the background on their own house), happenings, and local resources.

#### Making a neighborhood lively takes time and energy.

>Long-standing civic organizations were losing members as people felt too busy to get involved in their communities.(Putnam, Don't Bowl Alone, 20)

Therefore, how to refresh neighborhood involvements in a hurry life is more valueable in today's world.

A league of Slow Cities
> Mayor Paolo Saturnini of Greve-a slow city in Tuscany. "We just want to protect what is good in our lives and keep our unique town character."

Go for a stroll:
> Public art, welcoming businesses, benches, flowerbeds, even a vending cart could all help solidify this area as the place in your community where people go after dinner to see and be seen.

#### People's involvement and creation bring place alive.

Case1: Las Parcelas, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-transform cars and drugs market to community garden-residents set up outdoor community kitchen.

>What was once a terrible blight has been transformed into a place that embodies history, tradition, and promise.

Case2: Portland, Oregon-intersection of two street-residents are encouraged to make an intersection repair project.

>People may choose to do an intersection repair because they want a place for community interaction and seasonal celebrations, or simply because they want to slow traffic. The only costs are paint and other materials needed, which must be financed by the community.(22)

#### Community wealth refers to good quality public services.

>communities need social capital (the investments ordinary people make by putting time into local organizations) as much as they need economic capital (the investments banks and businesses make by putting money into neighborhoods).
