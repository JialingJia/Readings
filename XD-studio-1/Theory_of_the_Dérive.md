## Dérive-a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances
>The objective passional terrain of the dérive must be defined in accordance both with its own logic and with its relations with social morphology.

>Chombart de Lauwe notes that “an urban neighborhood is determined not only by geographical and economic factors, but also by the image that its inhabitants and those of other neighborhoods have of it.”

### Houjiang's uncertain thoughts
    1. Chance to enlarge person's neighborhood is small in the dérive, because in a new setting, people gradully become conservative and start to reduce their variants and alternation.
    2. Human beings are more likely to dérive than creatures without intelligence because we see things around on our own image.
    3. The average duration of dérive is a day, but has no necessary relation with solar day.

>An insufficient awareness of the limitations of chance, and of its inevitably reactionary effects, condemned to a dismal failure the famous aimless wandering attempted in 1923 by four surrealists

**Question:** does the sentence mean that the practice of four surrealists is a failure due to the unawareness of chance?

Small groups of two or three people who have reached the same level of *awareness* tends to dérive.
But when it comes to more people up to ten or twelve people, they will not come to a simultaneous dérive. However, the practice of such subdivision is hard to proceed.

### Questions List
    1. What's the awareness mean?
    2. What's an actual dérive in the forms of daily behavior
    3. "one dérive gives way to that of another" -does it means people dérive to another city when came to a new city before the time of dérive?

One sequence of dérive may change people's previous behavior.

### The factor that influence dérive:
    1. To study a terrain or to emotionally disorient oneself, two aspects of dérive would overlap together, so the spatial field of dérive may become vague.
    2. Some activities may distinguish different dérive, such as taking a taxi, because people concentrate with a personal trip outside one's usual surroundings.
### What we can learn from dérive:
    1. One can draw up things that nowadays map would miss, more likely in a psychogeographical way. For example, they can measure the city in two regions even though the distances have little relation with the physical distance between them.
    2. One can find the existence of psychogeographical central point of the city.
    3. It can leads to propose the constant diminution of less extended and indistinct bordering regions.

**Question**: why should the author propose to deminish those unprecise bordering regions?**
>"Within architecture itself, the taste for dériving tends to promote all sorts of new forms of labyrinths made possible by modern techniques of construction. "
