## Time in Print
The book is an attempt to create the time maps.
>The events must be...revealed as possessing a structure, an order of meaning, that they do not possess as mere sequence.

The chronological anal reflects the way how people think, behave at that time. Indian regards the genealogy and chronicle are powerful graphically way to describe the past, but not the primary way to write the history.

Timeline is visible but sometimes invisible. In a digital clock, the viewer translates the numbers into imagined points on a line.

>How this could be possible, what alternatives existed before, and what competing possibilities for representing historical chronology are still with us, is the subject of this book.

### Timeline appear until modernity:

**Fourth century, Europe, Table**

>The order of the *Chronicle* reflected the desire of early Christian scholars to make the Bible and the sources vital for understanding it available and readily accessible for quick reference.

**The Chart of Biography-watershed in time mapping, a common visual vocabulary for time maps caught on. But it still has problems: historical narrative is not linear.**

>Priestely and Sterne point to the technical ingenuity and the intensity of the labor required to support a fantasy of linear time

**When it comes to the 19th century, timeline was applied in many new areas, at the same time, other temporal figures for time mapping occurred.**

    1. Daniel depicted the four great empire as an armature for world history.
    2. The development of photography, film and other imaging technologies.
    3. Chronophotograhic apparatuses and the tree ring analysis, made visible for the first time events taking place
