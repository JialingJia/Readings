## Are scores maps? A cartographic response to Goodman

#### Daniel Miller:

*Notational components of scores are better understood as contingent surface-level features leveraged by an underlying map-like representational structure (1).* *A cartographic system of representation is a plausible alternative to a sentential theory of music scores (1).* *Goodman restricts this term to symbolic systems that fulfill strict criteria. The importance of defining a technical sense of the word notation, is to explicate how and in what cases we can be confident that a symbol refers without ambiguity (2).* *Semantic finite differentiation is sufficient to allow some tones to be identified as complying with no pitch in the notation (4).*

#### Reevaluation of Goodman's notational philosophy:

**Q:** How can Goodman's understanding of notational system be analyzed in terms of interface design guideline? Since interface design keeps changing due to new UI trend, therefore, is there any critical information need to be preserved fidelity regardless of different design trends or varied platform? What kinds of notation represent the essence of GUI?

Against with Goodman's interpretation of playing notes precisely, musicians find it stiff and contrived (4). **Q:** So is it possible for notation system reveal the quality of performance in some way? Or what could be done to visual represent the context within a performance?


### A Cartographic Theory of scores

Map=a broad construed class=overlapping graphs, infographics, diagrams, schematics, and charts, it fall somewhere between pictorial and sentential modes. Key word: Isomorphic

*What aspects of the world are represented and what aspects are omitted or stylized would seem to have a great deal of do with the power of maps to expand and clarify our understanding of specific spatial relationships (4).* *Scores represent an array of highly structured acoustic morphologies and performative actions through two-dimensional visual conventions (4).*

Score-depending on cognitive metaphors to translate back and forth between spatial and temporal domains rather than simple visual similarity (5). Within a map-structure score, sentential representation is far more conceptual than pictures or diagrams, while when it comes to certain sections of a work, it increase the expressive power of language beyond the contents of the sentential expression (5).

In a practical theory of cartography, scale factors directly influence the explicit of interpreting. However, score preservation still holds so long as the inaccuracy does not depart too far from the constraints of the scale (6). *By constraining pitch only loosely, the composer implicitly assents to the proposition that precise pitch is not a factor that affects score preservation. Rather, the map-like syntax implies that the ordering of pitches is mandatory, and changing the order of high and low pitches would pose an existential threat to score preservation.* **Q:** Is it a defense to our emotional experience mapping when professor judges the implicit of emotional feelings, if we consider the ordering of general emotion and mood fluctuation based on events is mandatory.
