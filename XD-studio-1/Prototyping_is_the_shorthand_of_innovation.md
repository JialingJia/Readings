### Prototyping is the shorthand of innovation

Prototyping is problem solving. It is a playful and iterative approach to problems. Prototyping helps us to discover mistakes as soon as possible. It's an iterative process, help you to resolve small but critical problems one by one.

What innovators do: breaking a problem down into its parts, making on-the-fly decisions in parallel.

Start doing things, writing, mapping, doodling or modeling, thinking while doing. Once you get in gear, you'll be surprised how easily some of the solutions appear.

Good prototype is not just a thing, it should highlight the essence of what a product, service, or business may become, it creates a moving, lively interactive situation.

Bit by bit: expressing the idea quickly and cheaply.

Protoyping evaluate your ideas faster, whether it works or not, let you shoot it down and perhaps discover something new.
