## "A Line with Variable Direction, which Traces No Contour, and Delimits No Form"

>two opposing ways of understanding the term 'diagram'

    1. an aid to systematisation-image of information are perceptual for human, easy to read and learn.
    2. proliferators of a process of unfolding-bring different elements like words, shapes, objects and persons together, explain the relationship among them.

>Correspondingly, diagrams would not only take care of "order and stability" but would also be a means to "destabilisation and discovery"

**Question:** What does the author describe diagram as "destabilisation" ? Does it mean that the relationship which the diagram show is open and uncertain, that offense its systematisation?

**Another ambivalance**

>Foucault: type of implanting of bodies in space, of the dividing of individuals in their relations to one another, of hierarchical organization, of the arrangement of centers and channels of power, of the definition of instruments and intervention tactics of power".

>The most important element of the diagram understood in this way is that it serves the description of the process whereby power relations are produced through relationships of strength.

Diagram have direct connection of people who see them.

 >the authorial viewpoint is always immanent to the field of observation. The location in space matters, positional relationship between the diagram and people's view decide what they see.

However, if we follow the explanation of diagram like this, every fixed point can become a pivotal point and diagram cannot be understood spontaneously. Therefore, diagram should follow rules, each elements such as intervals, distances, and locations can give guidance.

> While the specific nature of diagrams would be overlooked if one were to regard them exclusively as images, without understanding the relations being established with their help, it is only their representative nature which allows one to recognize how lines channel thought in a figurative as well as in a spatial sense.

Diagram serves to crystallize repeated reformulations of the concept of art.

Construction drawing.

As a tool for channeling the making of relationships and for the abandonment of a rational procedure.
