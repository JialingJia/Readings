## How story works

>Basically, he said that every story needs three things: characters, goals, and conflict. What weaves these elements together is a structure or a series of actions and events that have a shape to them.(chapter 2)

From the view of Aristotle, "structure" refers to a series of actions and events that have a shape to them. When it comes to Design System class, what Miso mentions about "structure"-is how parts of the system construct together-it explains the relationship or hierarchy of elements as a "shape" of the system.

>Every narrative arc has specific key plot points and sequences.

>The exposition functions not only to set the stage of a story, but also to get the person on the other end—you, the viewer—interested and engaged with the main character or characters and what drives them...At the very least, it compels you to empathize with them.(chapter 2, Exposition)

>The inciting incident is the first hook or trigger point in a story that amplifies if and how you identify with the main character, what problems he has, and what he has to go through to fix that problem and meet his goal. It’s what gets you hooked. When the main character is called to action, it’s as if you, the viewer, are called to action.(Chapter 2, Inciting Incident or Problem)

It's interesting that the development of story is how story interacts with you, first it makes you feel empathy, then it "calls you to action" with its action. Good products also make you feel free and easy to use them with motivation and encouragement.

>What’s great about story and its underlying structure is that it provides you with a framework—a formula, if you will—for turning your customers into heroes. (Chapter 2, Building Products with Story)

## Concept Story

The definition of Concept Story-"A concept story is the conceptual story model of your product: it illustrates the big picture overview of what a product is"(Chapter 3, What is a concept story)

When it comes with a product story, it actually combines user role and product together. People who use this product is the hero of his or her product experience.

**A Product Concept Story**
    1. Exposition-people's current state
    2. Inciting Incident-pain points
    3. Rising action-product
    4. Crisis-competitions from other Products or emotional resistance for using your product
    5. Climax/Resolution-problem resolve from exposition and crisis
    6. Falling action-people's convince and feedback of your concept
    7. End-goal complete

People's surprise of your product comes from how it solves the crisis. Compared from other competitors, iphone stands out for its convenient use of touchscreen.

> it requires you to meticulously assess and identify the root of a user or potential customer’s problem so that you can effectively design a solution that not only gets people excited, but also maps out how their brains see the world.(Chapter 3, Mapping a concept story)

The Business Model for Paid Content:
>But while the business saw a product that people could use, visitors just saw content. And visitors expected this content to be free, like the content they could find on YouTube. Why pay for access when there was probably a decent alternative out there that was free? We had to figure out how to engage users so that they would not only use the product, but also see the value in it and eventually upgrade. If we couldn’t figure this out, the business would fail.(Chapter 3, Finding the concept story in Fitcounter)

I think there is a gap between Crisis and Climax, only when the product comes up with expectation for people to fill it, they are willing to pay for it.  

>Climax/Resolution: The training plans they create look great—in fact, way better than what they could produce or find on YouTube. And they can personalize them and tailor them for their needs/level. The training plans are made of bite-sized videos that customers can easily fit into a regimen, and they are also easy to share and can be accessed anytime on the go.
