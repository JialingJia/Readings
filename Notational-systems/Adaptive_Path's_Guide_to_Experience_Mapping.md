## Adaptive Path's Guide to Experience Mapping

Customers' experience would break down when span multiple channels. Projects often focus on individual touchpoints, technologies, and features without a clear picture of the total customer experience, and ownership exists for touchpoints and products, but not for the customer journeys that cut across them.

### Step 1 Uncover the Truth

As a best practice, we recommend you scour your organization for existing data and insights relevant to the experiences you are attempting to map.

Talking to customers is indispensable.

### Step 2 Chart the Course

Making experience maps is a collaborative activity. "You should have a key group of stakeholders from across the organization who have been kept in the loop of your discovery and research."

What we should do on the Experience Mapping Workshop:

>Your role as facilitator is to create a clear context, outline the goals, guide participants through the activity, and keep everyone motivated and happy.

    1. Set the context
    2. Divide participants into teams
    3. Deconstruct-each team go through the research notes and pull out the building blocks
    4. Put sticky notes in to stages
    5. Group duplicate stickies and find relationships among them
    6. Arrange key insights into a story

### Step 3 Tell the Story

Sketch it into a story map/journey map

**Question:** In the Slides, it mentions "issue and opportunity" after finishing experience mapping, while isn't it an initiative stage or purpose for us to start mapping experience?
