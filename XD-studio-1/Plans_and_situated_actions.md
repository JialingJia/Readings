### Situated actions

Plan: this total process[of Trukese navigation]goes forward without reference to any explicit principles and without any planning, unless the intention to proceed to a particular island can be considered a plan.(49)

Situated actions: underscores the view that every course of action depends in essential ways upon its material and social circumstances...the approach is to study how people use their circumstances to achieve intelligent action.(49)
Such actions will not be reduced by uninterpreted bodily movements, nor is formed by secondary or epiphenomenal mentally.(50)

Is situated actions the subconscious reaction of circumstances by plan?

#### Plans are representations of action

George Herbert Mead: situated and ad hoc improvisation; retrospective action from the first. Plans and accounts are the forms we make objects of those actions. Therefore, our depictions of actions are in the form of imagined projections and recollected reconstruction.(51) However, such description raise questions on social science of the course of action...choice maker among alternative courses of action based on anticipated consequences, however, it's just a report on the choices made.

Alternative view: plans are resources for situated action, but don't determine tis course. Plan don't represent details of actions. The purpose of the plan is to orient you in such a way that you can obtain the best possible position from which to use those embodied skills on which, in the final analysis, your success depends.

Conclusion: Plan comes before action, "rationality anticipates action and reconstruct it afterwards".

#### Representation and breakdown

When action is proceeding smoothly it is essentially transparent to us, we start to feel invisible of it, the equipment 'disappear'. While with new and unfamiliar equipment, "inspection and practical problem-solving occur"(53), the way using it becomes a goal-oriented activity.

#### The practical objectivity of situations

"The environment of our actions is made up of a succession of situations that we walk in to, and to which we respond".

From Durkheim's maxim, the objective reality of social facts are based on actor's involvement with the 'social facts' to which we respond. And the social facts are already existed. However, Blumer argues that the social world is constituted by the local production of meaningful action.

Does Blumer's idea match Aristotle's of what makes a form?

"The outstanding question for social science, therefore, is not whether social facts are objectively grounded, but how that objective grounding is accomplished. Objectivity is a product of systematic practices..."(57)

"The task of social studies, then, is to describe the practices, not to enumerate their product in the form of a catalogue of commonsense beliefs about the social world. The interest of ethnomethodology, is in how it is that the mutual intelligibility and objectivity of the social world is achieved."(58)

#### The indexicality of language

To achieve shared understanding bases on perfectly adequate for purposes of interaction. Expression and interpretation involve an active process of pointing to and searching the situation of talk-that language is a form of situated action. "Indexicality"-meaning of expression is conditional on the situations.
