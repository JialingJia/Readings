### Clarifying Affordances

>The computer system already comes with built-in physical affordances. The computer, with its keyboard, display screen, pointing device, and selection buttons (e.g., mouse buttons) affords pointing, touching, looking, and clicking on every pixel of the screen. Most of this affordance is of little interest for the purpose of the application under design.

Real affordances do not always have to have a visible presence (and in some cases, it is best to hide the real affordance).

The cursor shape is visual information: it is a learned convention

Usually they mean that some graphical depiction suggests to the user that a certain action is possible. This is not affordance, either real or perceived. Honest, it isnâ€™t. It is a symbolic communication, one that works only if it follows a convention understood by the user.

 Affordances reflect the possible relationships among actors and objects: they are properties of the world.

### Constraints and Conventions

Physical Constraints, for example it is not possible to move the cursor outside the screen, locking the mouse button when clicking is not desired, restricting the cursor to exist only in screen locations where its position is meaningful.

Logical Constraints: use reasoning to determine the alternatives

Learned Convention: former experience learned by regulations and constraints

Symbols and constraints are not affordances. They are examples of the use of a shared and visible conceptual model, appropriate feedback, and shared, cultural conventions.
