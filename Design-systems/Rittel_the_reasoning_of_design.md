## The reasoning of design

Design is a complex and retrospective process. Though it comes with reasoning logical methodology, unlike classical problem solutions, problem definition keeps changing disorderly.(2) Therefore, Rittel discussed how we investigate those problems with eveluation.

**Question:** will such reasoning become a restriciton in creating products? and how to mitigate the possibilities of wrong answers due to limited knowledge when practicing?

Although tis article propose a reasoning way to address some prerequisite of design, practically speaking, he acknowledeged the varieties of reasoning(6). Environment constraints, personality traits, political powers and etc. each of them makes design a balance process.

The article is kind of self-answered.
