## The Language of the Visual world

Saussure's theory:
>focused on the exchange of meaning between individuals and on the commonalities across languages, rather than on the eccentricities arising from their specific cultural origins.

Saussrue considered sign as extended interpretations for sounds. However, he defined two components of a sign: the **SIGNIFIED** and **SIGNIFIER**.

>...The signified is the person, thing, event, place, or concept called forth by the stimulation of the signifier. The signifier is the sound or word ( or image, in the case of graphic design) that recalls in our mind the signified...

**Question:** When mentioning the effect of separating signifier and signified, and the importance of Saussure's contribution, does it mean that the material attributes of language-how it forms did influence its meaning?

### Langue and parole

also view as **syntax**
>In Saussure's terms, langue is the set of abstract rules with in the language
system that governs the combinations of signs-a group of general linguistic conventions adopted by a particular
social or cultural group that allows them to construct and exchange meaning among their members. Grammar is an example of langue...Parole...an individual act of discourse among many of infinite variety

In terms of visual language, syntax comes with the sequence and organization of the images. Although the early modernist movements in art and design challenge the conventional order of visual things, they understand "the principle of the syntagmatic axis as a sequencing of signs".

The Russian film theorist and director Sergei Eisenstein believed that "the break in continuous action or point of view will heighten the visual contrast for dramatic effect".

> He believed that an intentionally
disruptive nature in the sequence of images within a film , in the cell-to-cell relationships, was more powerful than the content and form achieved through of any single image.(111)

On the printed page, Futurist and Dadaist
compositions tried to loosely change the form of the text in order to "redirect the reading experience".(113)

>The intention was to redirect the reading experience, and subsequently the reader's attention to ideas, through spatial arrangements that defied the typical linguistic ordering of letters and words.

>The futurists were less antagonistic in their behavior but clearly believed that
the visual form of language should be an expression of new, modern times, not a reflection of another social reality.(115)

Around 1950s, Swiss Design implement strict hierarchies among typographic components:

> Grids controlled the proportions and alignments of photographs and text, dividing the page mathematically into
positive elements and negative white space...The system ensured visual harmony
among diverse elements within the composition and a clear hierarchy among information components...But so dominant was the langue or grammar of form at this point in design history that it appeared to offer little opportunity for designer
variation in the parole of individual solutions and responses to very different problems or content. In many cases, the system for arranging elements overshadowed the particular meanings of the elements themselves.

The typographic systems of late modernism sought to reduce the literal meanings of the word while shifted their focus on "a highly regulated hierarchy". In the view of post modernism designer, they tried to attach additional meanings through varnacular typefaces (for example, Western-themed content set in a typeface that looks like a wooden fence, or neon type for an article on the urban environment). They tend to connect the words to a more natural appearance which matches its literal meaning.

>The significance of Saussure's work, then, resides in the idea that language
operates on the basis of relationships: first, on the relationship between the
signifier and signified, and then on relationships among the rules of the system by which distinct signs are combined and separate from one another. (124)

Peirce's theory:
>A sign representation stands for something object to somebody interpretation some respect (ground).

Representation-Presentation-Interpretation-Coordination

Different from Saussure's idea, Peirce's model considered the broader notion of context as influencing interpretation and the material nature of the sign.(126)

**Icon:** the sign visually shares its physical properties, resembles that concept or thing for which it stands.

**Index:** a type of sign in which the relationship between the sign and what it stands for is habitual or causal. One step removed from the actual goal of the representation.

**Symbols:** a type of sign in which the relationship between the sign and what it stands for must be learned and is governed by a code or cultural convention.

Barthes:

he points out the **myth** when using symbols in a sense of advertisement which sometimes, misleads public understanding (a cover of *Paris Match* from 1955).

>In selling consumers the myth of higher social status, commerce speeds up the consumption of goods and secures the continuation of existing social positions by making it impossible to attain what is desired... his analysis of the fashion system illustrates how printed communication extends the meaning of the garment in an attempt to fuel consumption.
