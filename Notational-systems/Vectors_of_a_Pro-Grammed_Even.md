## Architecture: concept & notation

*Abundantly illustrated, it argues two fundamental points at the center of Tschumi's practice. First, architecture must be made out of ideas and concepts before becoming form. Second, it cannot be dissociated from the events and movement of the bodies that inhabit it. In consequence, architecture demands new modes of notation to construct an architectural language capable of embodying the interactions between space, event, and movement.*

### Vectors of a Pro-Grammed Event

Media-architecture is rather than a simple culture of the image, it is the dynamic of time, of the event. Tschumi use "Folly" as a solution to turn down the traditional model in architectural field. *not only those bequeathed by the long perspectivist and geometricist tradition but also those formulated by the rationalist ideology of the Enlightenment, remobilised equally by modernist and postmodernist architecture.*

Don't understand:
*This focus on the mechanisms of repetition and reproduction of a cultural industry based on reproducibility (photography , cinema, advertising) enables Tschumi to highlight the effect of reification , to establish a distance in which the body petrified in the image is projected into the real - a folding back onto itself of representation - in a re materialisation that opens a new field of possibilities, that of a language that refuses the vocabularies of composition and proportion and the identitarian metaphors of plan or construction.

#### The Order of Dissociation

Anticipating the urban of today, Cedric Price wrote "The varied and ever-changing activities, will determine the form of the site. To enclose these activities, the anti-building must have equal flexibility. Thus the prime motivation of the area is caused by the people and their activities and the resultant form is continually dependent on them." Close to Price, Alexander Trocchi views architecture as a spontaneous territory where technologies are no longer instruments but form. *Architecture becomes an "environment trigger".*

Tschumi develops a new form of architectural design, integrating image, body and denotation of urban space. *Redefining space in terms of activity , relocalizing space by conjoining different temporal sequences (the memory of the site, the localization of action, registration in the image): a logic gradually emerged that enabled the architect to organize an order of dissociation of space and event, introducing movement as the dynamic, correlating element. (24)*

Sergei Eisenstein's diagram for Alexander Nevsky (1938): **incorporates image frames, soundtrack, and the spatial composition of shots as well as the diagrammatic representation of movements.**

Tschumi vindicates: *this diagrammatic composition which, by combining material and immaterial components, leaves architecture open to a dynamic and cognitive understanding.*
