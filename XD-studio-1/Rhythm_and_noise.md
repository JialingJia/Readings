## City as Archive

Archive changes when time past, it cannot avoid being abandoned, ruined or lost. Michael Sheringham points out that cities are indeed a form of archive-one where the past in conveyed through the everyday materiality and lived practice that shapes their composition.

Hetherington emphasized the functionality of city as their representation as heritage, and its importance has been raised from the last three decades. The Tate Modern Gallery in Britain and Expos Exhibition in Shanghai and Abu Dhabi, all of the redevelopment of museums and culture centers have proved a direct boost to local economy from culture regeneration. While Hetherington mentioned an opposite side of using culture heritage as a branding or marketing strategy, that is it heavily relied on consumerist stance. The merge of museums , art and heritage sector would fail inevitably based on global economy recession. Therefore, author has described "an apportune moment to speak and to make an intervention that proposes new models of thinking about the past through heritage"-a new model of " a set of relations that are fluid and mobile" with "present uncertainty".

"Voice" and "mobility" of urban spatiality as Hetherington proposed, are the way how people pass and move through "the materiality of ruins". And he assumes that this kinds of mobility including derive or other forms might help to analyse the relation from the past to the present and future. Those two patterns influence urban heritage.

Henri Lefebvre proposed that people's daily movements produce "ripples" that influence and change the city unconsciously. Such rhythm is
mostly established by capital. And also for Lefebvre, noise is "the background out of which rhythmic patterns of life and activity emerge". In Hetheringtong's view, he thoughts that when rhythms emerged from noise, it comes with cultural memories.

Hetheringtong also points out that, based on Lefebvure's opinions thinking of social space as a pastry, the derelict sites can also affects the city with their own rhythm. For example, ruins in different time give contrast for city's present environment, which in turn, improve people's cultural and economic awareness.

When it comes a closer view of noise, it is of great importance to hear it(Hetheringtong), because hearing can be able to recognize multiplied possibilities from noise. Hetherington and others, they consider the "voice" of city including narrations from local residents and urban materialities.

Poetry, as a main resource for discovering the voice on ruins through images, makes sense of the past through key words is what like the author said "culturally and economically developed". It is effective to "draw out elements from that noise" and to recognize the "punctum or the disruptions that ripple through an unban archive and unsettle its sense of certainty".

"Mobility" also named as "footprint"-people moving through space in a more fluid and dynamic way-gives new oppotunities of contrasting the city's past and present. In drifting, due to the unfamiliarity, "an intimate attention to the detials of place" may challenge or disrupt singularity fomart of the city(myths and place branding are typically constructed).

In conlusion, what Hetherington suggested to do with those ruins is not to recover or regenerate the past as a way of museum or culture center, but to live it opened to people's visiting, where the direlicts and the left of the past may offer unexpected and constrast feeling. "that is the basis for urban rhythm." "The archive is a noisy place and out of that noise rhythms of cultural memory emerge and their soundings resonate both with and against notions of heritage."
