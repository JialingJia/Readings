### The Experience Economy

*When a person buys a service, he purchases a set of intangible activities... But when he buys an experience, he pays to spend time enjoying a series of memorable events that a company stages...to engage him a personal way. (2)*

The commoditization trap: *In a Service Economy, the lack of differentiation in customers' minds causes goods to face the constant price pressure indelibly associated with commodities. As a result, customers more and more purchase goods solely on price and availability. (9)*

The characteristics of an Experience: sensorializing goods, add elements that enhance the customer's sensory interaction with them; making goods scarce-by making its good scarce, heightens the experience of having one.

*Each successive offering...greatly increase in value because the buyer finds each more relevant to what he truly wants.*

*Those which thrive will do so because they treat their economic offering as a rich experience, not a glorified good or celebrated service, staged in a way that engages the individual and leaves behind a memory. (29)*

#### Experience Realms

Passive Participation and active participation, customers personally affect the performance or event that yields the experience; absorption and immersion, the guest "goes into" experience.
