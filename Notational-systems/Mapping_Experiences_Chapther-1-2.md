### Introduing Alignment diagrams

>I wasn’t locked into one prescribed method over another. I realized the focus should not be on a specific technique but rather on the broader concept of value alignment.

**Value-centerd design:** starts a story about an ideal interaction between an individual and an organization and the benefits each realizes from that interaction.

**Alignment Diagrams:** refers to any map, diagram, or visualization that reveals both sides of value creation in a single overview. It is a category of diagram that illustrates the interaction between people and organizations.

**Two Parts:** individual's experience and organization's offerings and processes. Points of interaction between the two are the means of value exchange.

How blueprints/customer journey maps/experience maps/mental model diagrams illustrate their similarities：
1. **Touchpoints**-where there is an exchange of value, a line of interaction
2. seperation of individual tasks, feelings, and philosophies from support for achieving their goals from various products or service

Benifts of Alignments Diagrams
     1. bring focus
     2. reveal opportunities
     3. build empathy
     4. provide common "big picture"
     5. break down silos
     6. enjoy longevity.

### Fundamentals of Mapping experiences

>Mapping experiences allows you to locate transitional volatility within a broader system of interactions and find innovative solutions to address it.

1. Frame the effort clearly up front. Determine the point of view, scope, focus, and structure of the diagram, as well as how you intend to use it

2. Identify the various touchpoints in the system, as well as critically charged points, called moments of truth.

3. Focus on creating value. Use the diagram to improve and to innovate your offering and your business.

### Framing the Mapping Effort

A matter of selection. Maps are purposefully focused.

#### Point of View

What is it about? From which point of view-such as a news magazine, readers or advertisers-you want to illustrate?

As for a reader, consider:
     1. Purchasing behavior
     2. News consumption
     3. Day-in-the-life, how news magazines fit into their daily actions...

#### Scope

>The point is to be explicit about the tradeoffs you’re making upfront and set the right expectations.

#### Focus

which aspects come to the foreground

#### Structure

**Chronological:** Because experiences happen in real time, a chronological arrangement provides a natural sequence of human behavior. A timeline of some sort is the most prevalent way to structure alignment diagrams.

**Hierarchical:** removes the time dimension. This can have advantages when there are many aspects occurring simultaneously, which is difficult to show chronologically.

**Spatial:** This makes sense when interactions take place in a physical location—for example, in a face-to-face service encounter. But they can also be imposed on an experience in a metaphorical sense: spatial maps represent experiences as if they could exist in a 3D space even when they do not.

**Network Structure:** shows a web of interrelationships between aspects of an experience that are neither chronological nor hierarchical.

#### Use

Who use? What they use for?how the diagram will be used?

### Identify Touchpoints

Static-Interactive-Human

>A touchpoint is a point of interaction involving a specific human need in a specific time and place.(Chris Risdon)

### Moments of Truth

Insigts for identifying and understanding critical points in the experience. These keys, emotional instances help focus attention on the aspects that matter most.
