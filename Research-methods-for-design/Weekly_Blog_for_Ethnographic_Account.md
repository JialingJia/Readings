# Ethnographic Account

### Summary
Why HCI needs ethnography? Professor Dourish lists out the former relationship between them that HCI and interaction design try to use ethnography as the approach to bring inclusion or conclusion for design guidance- Implications of Design, but more than that, he explains it as an exploratory research to uncover truths and generate important knowing. In order to compensate the solitary priority of HCI focus on task performance, research in emotion and affective computing start to investigate adding emotion to a responsive interaction system. However, Dourish argues that it is inappropriate to simply supplement emotion alongside with cognition process, for its temporal and situated essence, and ethnography could help us to better understand emotion in a background or immersive cultural environment and view it as the outcome along human culture practice.

The other reading Reading and Interpreting Ethnography precisely describes how ethnography develops. First, the subject or said aim of ethnography changes from data collection to cultural understanding. Second, the object shifts from geographically bounded social wholes to structured system and evolving patterns of the culture, then to any level of human phenomenon when geographic boundary blurs. Third, the value within ethnography starts to be explained as offering multiple, indefinite and open interpretations, but not explanation of “fact of the matter”. Moreover, he clarifies the contradiction between ethnography situated context as opposed to the generation of abstract models in HCI, which seeks to apply the generalized understanding to other range of settings. Abstraction is a communication approach to extract generalized concept or model which can highly interpret truth and situated observation from one phenomenon. Ethnography could offer us with these abstract models, which can engage other people to start understanding or even practicing.  

### Questions left after class:
How to understand the word of “conceptual and imaginative”, does it represent the opposite of “mix and match” approach of HCI?

>I am arguing that the movement from ethnographic engagement to design practice is inherently a conceptual and imaginative move rather than a rote translation of empirical evidence into designed fact. (13, Responsibilities and Implications)

Why those cases which only have a well reasoning process such as falsification or verification can be viewed as representative? why not just a normal case?

>It is frequently observed that the most valuable informants are often people whose status is somewhat marginal or peripheral (since they have a useful insider/outsider perspective on the situation). (14, Reading and Interpreting Ethnography)

### Other Interesting take-aways from the reading:

Reading and Interpreting Ethnography

>If we accept a view of ethnographic material as the product of occasions of participative engagement, then we surely need to be able to inquire into the nature of that engagement… what makes just this statement or action make sense in context? (14)

>A statement, utterance or action is taken, ethnographically, as documentary evidence of its own production; that is, the interesting thing isn’t necessarily what was said, but that it could be said, that it was a sensible thing to be said by just that person in just those circumstances and in just that way… it is not a question of dividing the world into true statements and false ones. (15)
