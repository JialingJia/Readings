**Mapping Experiences Chapter Five**

## Investigate: Researching the Experience

>people’s behaviors are often irrational. They act on emotions and subjective beliefs. These are harder to understand and quantify, and are generally not part of the business vernacular.

Diagramming experience is a way or incentive for us to discuss and spark conversation, what really matters comes from ideas inspiration and shared empathy.

>Of course, the diagrams themselves don’t create empathy, but they spark and guide the conversations that do.

### Three steps for organizing you research findings

Evidence(direct sources)-Interpretations(potential causes and explanation for people's behavior)-implications for the experience-conclusions

Sometimes, we need to make iterative discoveries about the facts and causes after concise conclusions.

### Interview within the organization

**Question:** When selecting interviewees, how to make sure that they are enough representative? Or how to selectively interpret their conversation.

> Your interviews should not be a questionnaire but rather guided discussions with participants.

    1. Create Draft Diagram
    2. Create Touchpoint Inventory
    3. Interview with non-direct topics

>This type of interviewing is an art. The challenge is balancing between a nondirected conversation and getting feedback on the specific topics you need to learn about. It’s the interviewer’s job to drive the conversation, letting go of control at times, and jumping in and steering the session at others.

### Conduct Research Externally

Try to conduct interviews on locations.

#### Field Research
    1. Prepare
    2. Parts of an interview-greet the participant, conduct the interview, make observations, conclude

#### Debrief
   1. informal analysis-group relative notes
   2. formal analysis-use a qualitative text analysis tool to comb through the transcribed texts

>First, upload interview texts (upper left), create a list of themes to code passages (lower left), and apply the codes to the interview texts (center). Finally, view all coded passages across interviews for a given theme in one place (right).

#### Quantitative Research

**Question:** after collecting enough data as background information, how do we choose the research approaches among interview, qualitative research and field research?
