# Forsythe, Choreographing Objects

### Reading Notes:
William Forsythe, as a skillful Ballet dancer, use an anti-choreography approach-choreographic objects, to provoke people's raw sense of body reflection. Choreographic objects teach us how environment influence our behavior under a first-order cybernetic, which means, when we are exposed to these strong, abnormal inadaptation environment, the uncontrolled body movements make us feel a sense of separation of consciousness and behavior, which in turn, remind us the materiality of human body itself.

### Reading take-aways:

William Forsythe:

>Choreography often serves as a channel for the desire to dance. One might well assume, then, that the substance of choreographic experience resides exclusively in the body; but is it possible for choreography to generate autonomous, accessible expressions of its, principles-"choreographic objects"-without body?

>A choreographic object is, by nature, open to a full range of unmediated perceptual instigations without having to prioritize any type of recipient...objects instigate processes in the body that instrumentalize the body's readiness to provide input for our heuristically driven...A principal feature of the choreographic object is that the preferred outcome is a form of knowledge production for whoever engages with it, engendering an acute awareness...
.
>Thus..."choreographic object" is intended as a categorizing tool that can help identify sites within which to locate the understanding of potential organization and instigation of action-based knowledge, with this tool...choreographic thinking...of arts practice can be thrown into relief.

Eva Respini:

>In a world where social exchanges are increasingly mediated and abstracted via technology, audiences are looking for interactive experiences (which are, of course, disseminated via social media). In today's digital arena, dance and performance provide a vital connection to our bodies, and to one another.

>Though isolated features of Forsythe's concerns...it alters our understanding of the body as a material to be molded within public sphere.

>Like Forsythe, these artists have created works where the primary consideration is not optical but rather the fostering of haptic encounters through touch, sound, and sometimes even scent.
