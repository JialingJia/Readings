### Design Languages, Notation Systems, and Instructional Technology

 *The qualities of a notation system have major impact on the rate of growth of the related design (59).* How does simplicity of a notation system relate to its extensibility?

#### Dimensions of a Notation System

*Most notation systems are not computable, but notation system designers should realized the potential power of computability and consider it as they invent notation systems (65).* The binary table is a great notation transition from linguistics to computability.

*An imprecise notation system is exemplified by the recording of foreign names and sounds in English, particularly when the foreign language uses a different character set, as with Cyrillic, Hebrew, Chinese, or Japanese, and so forth. Because there are no rules for the capture of foreign language syllables in English, their notation varies widely in literature and in news report (65).* The example of recording of different languages in a specific language notation system seems inappropriate. For the reason that, when it comes to different context, using any notation language to interpret another language would become imprecise. The ambiguity of notation system is considered the degree of inaccuracy for its designated compliance, not for another subject.

*Interpretable versus noninterpretable* Music score, play and dance notation can be interpreted by different performance, the aim for this kind of notation system is to preserve the copy of performance while reproduce then. However, the underground mapping system might be improper to be compared with music score as the same notation system. Rather than notation system, it is more likely a visual documentary system.
