# The Urban Improvisation

### Reading Notes:
Improvisation performance of human are prominent in today’s urban environment. All the embedded computing systems such as digital wall, mobile connected device will prompt iterative reflection of people from their first interactions. What’s more, due to the growth of the artificial intelligent context, how people react to machine’s learning feedback and how human and machine come together as a whole to behave, their unexpected behaviors and systematic results could bring new meanings for us to design in this dynamic hybrid environment.

### Questions left behind:
The article illustrates how the Viewpoint Improvisation could contribute to urban lighting condition through the notion of “light follows people”. Confused about the cause and effect between the Viewpoint and actors’ performance, I learn that the change of viewpoint cause actor’s improvised behaviors, which seems to be the opposite of the notion of “light follows people”.

People walk in a different way when they are at day and night. They walk less flexible in night because of limited visibility, which refers to that lighting is a guide for them. How might the improvised lighting work if people are in a prior awareness of following the light but not followed by the light? I regard that improvisation is different from response action, the former is a self-intended interaction from human and environment, while the later is a passive feedback from both.

### Reading Highlights:
>…improvisation…where iterative and recursive operations lead to the emergence of dynamic structures that continue to feed into the action itself.

Four key positions:
>(1) Design for initiative ensures **openness**; (2) awareness of time ensures **the relevance of actions**; (3) **forms of action are understood in the making**; and (4) interactions themselves are other than expected.

>Theater is presented as a model for the performance of intentional activity in which **both human and computer have a role, concerned with representing whole actions that involve multiple agents.**

>Although this conceptual model opens up fascinating new ground, it refers only to **scripted** theater.

>In the sense that drama formulates the enactment and not the action, it is unlike real life…**actions are situated in a unique context that is always in flux, and the focus is on dynamic choice in a dynamic environment.**

>To talk about improvisation also means to consider the notion of **inventiveness**, involving elements both of novelty and of repetition of past patterns.

>Planning and action collapse into a single moment, and the **configuration of content in time and space molds the meaning of action.**

>In the design of urban interactions, **this ability to recognize form in the making puts the focus on cues and indexicality of gesture and behavior.**
