### Flow diagrams: Rise and fall of the ﬁrst software engineering notation

#### The Derive of Software Engineering Notation

In order to transform computation problem into code,  Goldstine and von Neumann acknowledge the importance of how an efficient and transparent terminology or symbolism could help in software programming. Therefore, they proposed approach involved the drawing of 'flow diagrams'.

In the era of Leonardo da Vinci, early scientists emphasize the flow of water, visualizing its movement, mechanical motion interacting with lock gates, weir and cross-section of sluice. *The studies of water ﬂow per se made by Leonardo emphasize the lines of movement and the shapes of vortices rather than phenomena such as spray or the play of light. (2)*

When it comes to the industrial revolution, graphical representations of flow in the manufacture about how nature raw transform into finished goods, is considered as 'flow sheet'. Then it is superseded by 'flow diagram', 'flowchart'. With a special reference of 'block', as representing the main machines on the space, the skeleton or block flow-sheets *serve as a frame upon which to hang the actual and of course more involved ﬂow-sheet following... has carried through to the most recent diagrammatic conventions, including those presented for software engineering.*

Early industrial conventions: Top-down format.

Gantt chart: first created for industrial management, emphasizing *the overall sequence of operations and hence the layout of machines on assembly floors  in order to maximize use of machines, in particular by providing a steady supply of materials or partially completed products.* then was also used to information flow.

#### The GvN type and after

Tow fundamental differences from previous chart: their domain is now **abstract and mathematical** rather than material, their use is embedded within a staged process, and is related to specified operational semantics of a computational machine.

*The diagram is “a schematic of the course of C(ontrol) through the sequence” of code that will be consequently deﬁned.*

Turing started to use 'block schematic diagram' for an essential aid in defining subroutines. *Turing deﬁnes ‘Programming principles’ which presuppose a two level combination of main program and sub-routines...he recommends comprise ‘plan making’, ‘breaking the problem down’ and ‘programming subroutines’ (10)*

     1. Plan: apportionment of storage to various duties + mathematical approach and formulae;
     2. Block schematic diagram: provide aid to 'plan' at the subsidiary level of the subroutine;

As opposed to GvN explicit characteristic, *Flow diagrams have become a general purpose tool for planning an automated computation at all levels of composition or decomposition (10)*

However, when it comes to some complex mathematical algorithms,*understanding the process demands the use of ﬂow diagrams.*

#### Formalization, diversification and demise

1956, Pegasus manual was created for public use, *The ﬂow-diagram itself “expresses the ‘algebra’ of the process”.*

The focus of flow diagram has been transferred from early logic of algorithmic processes towards broader concerns of software engineering. *As structured development gained favor in the 1970s and 1980s, ﬂow diagrams came to be used to model the logic of workﬂow and structured ﬂowcharts were introduced to add discipline to the design of lower-level code. With the move to object-oriented analysis and design in the 1980s and into the 1990s there was even less need to express detailed algorithmic processing as part of routine practice. (13)*
