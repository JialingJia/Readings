# How to tell a good design story from a design system view

Storytelling is a way that you interact with others. It's a conversation, but more than a conversation. It's a presentation, but more than a presentation. As a designer, telling a story is creating an experience to your audience. From the course learning from Design Systems in NEU, I want to go deeper on how a design system view helps me to better a design project, especially on how I discover the design opportunities and present my ideas.

In terms of Design System, we are talking about Structure, Form, Process and other concepts. We try to conceptualize the design process into much simplifier pattern and guide designing action. For example, we view a chair as a static system, while human pushing a chair is a dynamic system. A house heating system controlled by a temperature sensor is a "self-regulating system", while human adjusting the sensor based on their feeling then the house temperature changed is a "learning system" (Dubberly et al. 71). Generally speaking, we are encouraged to apply the dynamic and learning system into design process, to make it more resistant and sustainable. We synthesize different design cases into design language, then apply that to other design cases, this is how Design System works.

Story is a way to share understanding, and a good story helps words make sense. From the view of Aristotle, he said that every story needs three things: characters, goals, and conflict. Lichaw further explains that, "what weaves these elements together is a structure or a series of actions and events with specific key plot points and sequences" ("How story works"). So, he dissects a good story into a plot relation map.

### But what does the design system mean for a design story?

When it comes to a design project or a design proposal, via Double Diamond Model, we learn some commonalities of the design process, there are Discover, Define, Develop and Delivery. Another explanation is Research, Insights, Ideation and Prototype. However, these four elements are not sufficient for a good design project. In Lichaw’s words, we still need to weave them together in a meaningful structure, rather than using them as the chapter name for a portfolio. I would like to describe this relationship as the Design Logic, which means, how well your insights are generated from research, how well your ideations are instructed by insights and how well your prototype can demonstrate the last three parts. A good design story teller is better at explaining the relationship or hierarchy of those design elements.

### Try to proof your ideation process by an acknowledged basis.

To my perspective, an effective criterion of how to form that relationship is whether your ideas can be explained effectively by some design concepts. Although it is not a guarantee that any good design project matches the design concepts, it is worthy of applying those when explaining your ideation process. For instance, in the course project of Design for Infor-rich Environment, I use the linear interaction system to explain the reasons of why Rheumatoid Arthritis patients are not willing to keep their daily medical records when using medical health apps. The system map clearly illustrates the relationship among patients, doctors and medical apps and highlights a reasoning process of how pain points are generated. Therefore, let your Discover make sense.

### A design story needs to be considered as a macro design system.

In a team-based project of Design Systems class, we apply Lichaw’s plot map into the project presentation. We create a storyline for this presentation experience, which is developed with exposition, inciting incident, climax and denouement. Audience are invited to pick out their own interest cards-learn how sensory memory is being generated and becomes short-term memory-and stick them to a memory brochure. After that, we let them use key words to write down how they feel about the dementia and teach them how to improve memory by using tricks to remember names from a Nobel Price list-what is memory disorder and memory enhancement. The process was developed from simple tasks to difficult ones, from warm-up to climax. At last, the memory brochure also records what they learn as takeaways. Using those physical interactive events entertain audience, let them become more engaged with the presentation. Audience are invited to help us complete the presentation together, which becomes a workshop or a performance.

Storytelling is a dynamic system. If it is a talk show, the speaker needs to keep entertaining audience with rhythmic humor. If it is a workshop, the host needs to set different interactive sessions. If it is a video game, the master needs to provoke new activities. However, no matter what kinds of storytelling, we all need to manage audience’s prediction with a narrative arc.  

The course syllabus explains why a system perspective is so important for today’s complex design problems. Because it helps you discover a universal design logic. We learn how to understand the characteristics of different design systems through Structure, Process, Form and Delivery, and how to rationally apply them in different cases.    

>In the first project, students will be asked to work in a team...They will first design an internal model of the system for the team, and then a communicational model of the system for the people who they will invite to the island. In the second project...They will first design a service system for themselves in current daily life, and then redesign it to work as a sustainable system for the future.
